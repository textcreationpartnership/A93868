            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE Reader, Shewing the Reaſons of publiſhing the preſent Treatiſe in theſe times.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough we are fallen into an age, where books of all ſorts do abound; yet in two caſes (as long as the Lord hath a Church upon the earth,) there will be ſtill need of writing more.</p>
            <p>The firſt, when many divine myſteries do remain ſtill incloſed, and ſealed up in the Scriptures, no man will doubt (upon ſuch a ſuppoſal) but it is the duty of thoſe that read (according to ability) to bring the truth to light. I did in order to this, publiſh a Tract concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Beaſt, his name, mark, and the number of his name, &amp;c. Here if any will ſay, ſhall we be wiſer than our fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to endeavour the diſcovery of that, which they could never finde out? The anſwer is cleare, truth is the Daughter of Time: A Pigmy upon a Gyants ſhoulder, may ſee farther than the Gyant himſelf: Even ſo we ſtanding upon the ſhoulders, and enjoying the labours of thoſe that have gone before, may ſee as farre as they did, and by wading into further depths, may go further than they. Upon this account it doth more peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
<pb facs="tcp:168516:3"/>belong to us, to continue the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> where they left it, to adde to the ſtock of knowledge, to be clear, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> were confuſed, to turne into the way, where they went <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and to bring thoſe things to light that have been, either totally, or in part obſcured from them. Some are of the judgment that we are come to the very <hi>Zenith,</hi> and top of all kinde of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that we know already, all that we need know. But an hundred, and a thouſand enſamples, may be ſhewed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: We are dark in many of thoſe things that are reſerved for the induſtry and diligence of the latter times. If men would convert the courſe of their ſtudies this way; as they would make a better return of their labours, ſo they would be leſſe prejudicial to the writings of former times: At leaſt all muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that there will be juſt occaſion of printing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> books, as long as new matter remains to be publiſhed to the world.</p>
            <p>A ſecond caſe of new writing, is; when the plain, fundamenal, &amp; common truths of God, are made dark by the new fangled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinious, and brangling queres of each age; In ſuch a caſe a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity doth lie upon us; and woe is unto us, if we do not plead for the truth, when it is notably and eminently endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered by others. In the preſent caſe I have not to do ſo much with that which is darke, and abſtruſe in its own nature; but with that which is made ſo, by the deviſes and ſubtilties of men. The doctrine of original ſin, and the natural ſervitude of the will (at leaſt to any ſpiritual good) is plainly enough ſet forth in the Scriptures, yet there are more than too many in theſe times, who endeavour with all their might, to draw a cloud over this cleereneſſe. I cannot ſee but as a Miniſter is to preach, and to live according to the truth; ſo it is his office and duty alſo to clear the ſame truth, from the errours, and intanglements of his own age. As evil manners occaſion good Laws, ſo evil opinions, and evil interpretations of Scripture, (ſpecially) where gain-ſaying ſpirits do endeavour to puddle the ſtream) ſhould make us more skilfull in the myſtery of ſalvation. Whatſoever the reaſon is, many of the friends and followers of the ſeparation with us, do not reſt ſatisfi'd with the denyal of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm, but they proceed alſo to deny al infants to be born
<pb facs="tcp:168516:3"/>in original ſin: The confeſſion of the faith of the thirty ſeparate Congregations, hath not (as farre as I can perceive) any one word of the ſin of the nature: Some do more apparently deny the thing, and others are more cloſe in what they hold. But Maſter <hi>Everard</hi> in his Book entituled, <hi>the Creation and the fall of man,</hi> containes the ſubſtance of all their arguments. Which Tract of his, ſeeing it is ſpread farre and neare, to the deceiving of many poore ſoules, and to the troubling of others. I have thought it neceſſary to examine all the material paſſages, and to detect the ſubtilties and fallacies thereof. The chief points he doth inſiſt on, are theſe; whether had <hi>Adam</hi> the Spirit, or was he a ſpiritual man before his fall? Secondly, how farre do obedient actions proceed from the operation of the Spirit: and how farre are they a mans own act? Thirdly, he treats concerning the contrariety of the two wills, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and the revealed will of God. Laſtly, he cometh to the maine point, to aſſert the innocency and the purity of the natural birth. And for this he ſeemes to himſelfe, and others of that way to have ſome coulourable reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>When I had done with him, there came to my hand the <hi>Examen</hi> of the late Aſſemblies Confeſſion of Faith: I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether one, or more are the Authours: Some cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances do not obſcurely inſinuate it to be the act of more than one man, and therefore in the enſuing Diſcourſe, I do ſpeak of them in the plural number; Becauſe in the points of free will and original ſinne, they do concord with Maſter <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verard,</hi> and the <hi>Antipedobaptiſts</hi> of our Vicinity. I have taken them into the Company to which they do belong.</p>
            <p>Now this laſt year (conſidering the State of our Affairs) when certain friends of mine, Miniſters as well as others, did deſire me to publiſh what I had written: At the ſame time did Doctor <hi>Jeremy Taylor</hi> ſet forth his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num Neceſſarium.</hi> In that Book of his Chap. ſix, as alſo in two other ſmall Treatiſes, <hi>the anſwer to the Biſhops letter,</hi> and <hi>The Further Explication,</hi> doth the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour fall upon our differences: alleadging the ſame things, in effect, which our <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> for certaine yeares paſt, have
<pb facs="tcp:168516:4"/>alleadged againſt us. Onely this difference is to be made, he doth aſcribe much to the Teſtimonies of the Fathers, and other Ancient Authours; They do ſlight all ſuch kindes of authority: He doth owne (for ought as I could ever hear) the Baptiſme of infants: They more ſecurely to deny in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſme, do ſeeme alſo, upon the ſame reaſon, to deny all Infants to be borne in original ſinne. His Writings are like to have a free paſſage in all the parts of the Land: Theirs for ought as I can heare, are received more chiefly in their own ſociety. His Writings, conſidering the greatneſſe of his learning, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of his ſtile, and the favour he beares to the Epiſcopal cauſe, are like to paſſe with thoſe that are Friends of that way: They (whatſoever their intereſts) their Principles do not go in that ſtreame. He in many caſes, is too much for that which is old: and they contrarily, are too much for that which is new: What reaſons did firſt move him to enterpriſe the buſineſſe, he himſelfe doth relate, in his owne words. <hi>Theſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have I choſe to ſay and publiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I finde that the uſual Doctrines, about original ſinne, are not onely falſe, and preſumed, without any competent proofe, but becauſe as they are commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, they are no friends to Piety, but Patrons to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and diſhonourable to the reputation of Gods goodneſſe and justice,</hi> and more to that purpoſe he hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explicated, page 502. Here I do willingly agree with him, that great circumſpection ought to be uſed in the right handling of theſe things. But then on the otherſide he hath ſpecial cauſe to beware that he do not turn to the more dangerous extreame.</p>
            <p>Original ſinne (in that ſenſe as we define it) cannot be denyed, but upon the denyal many deſperate abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will enſue. We had a conference with the Brethren of the ſeparation at a Neighbour-Towne, <hi>Anno</hi> 1654. <hi>February</hi> the 22. Becauſe they occaſioned the diſpute by diſturbing the Miniſter of the place, and were ſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious of the point; We did put it upon them to
<pb facs="tcp:168516:4"/>anſwer the queſtion as followeth. If all infants be born free from original ſinne, when do they beginne to be ſinners, that we may call them ſo? They told us when they did act ſinne. We replyed, then in all that ſpace of time from the conception in the wombe to their acting of ſinne they are all free? They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; they are all free: we demanded, why is it then the peculiar prerogative of Chriſt, if infants in all the forementioned ſpace do partake of the ſame privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? To this they ſaid, that infants are as free from all ſinne as Chriſt himſelfe. We told them that we did much admire at the boldneſſe of ſuch an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: They anſwered, ſet his Godhead aſide, they are as pure as Chriſt himſelfe was pure. We rejoynd, why was the Lord Chriſt conceived of the Holy Ghoſt, and borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary?</hi> To this, they made no great Anſwer: And the ſtanders by did ſeeme to looke upon ſuch a poſition with a kinde of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
            <p>But as ſtrange as the Tenet is, I finde that Doctor <hi>Jeremy Taylor,</hi> the Authour above named, doth not ſhun to ſay the ſame thing in effect, at leaſt he ſeemes to go very neare to that coaſt. For in his anſwer to the Biſhops letter, he bringeth the Biſhop ſpeaking after this manner. <hi>If there be no ſuch thing as original ſinne tranſmitted from</hi> Adam <hi>to his poſterity, then all that ſixth Chapter is a ſtriſe about a ſhadow, a</hi> Non ens. <hi>Anſw. It is true my Lord,</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>The queſtion, as it is uſually handled, is ſo: For when the Franciſcan and the Dominican do eternally diſpute about the conception of the Bleſſed Virgin: whether it was with or without original ſinne, meaning by way of grace, and ſpecial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption, this</hi> de non ente, <hi>for there was no need of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch exemption: And they ſuppoſing that commonly it was otherwiſe, troubled themſelves about the exception of a rule, which in that ſenſe, which they ſuppoſed was not true at all: ſhe was borne as innocent from any impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and formal guilt as</hi> Adam <hi>was created, and ſo was
<pb facs="tcp:168516:5"/>her Mother, and ſo was all her family.</hi> In which words of his, if he had ſaid that his owne anſwer to the Biſhops letter was a meere <hi>non ens,</hi> he had ſpoken more truly: for where there is no ſuch thing as the Biſhop of <hi>Rochester</hi> at all, what anſwer can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his letter? But whereas he ſtands upon it, that the impurity of the natural birth from <hi>Adam</hi> the root of corruption, is a meere <hi>non ens,</hi> what will you make of regeneration, and of Baptiſme the waſhing of regeneration? Where there is no ſinfulneſſe in the natural generation, what need of Baptiſme or regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at all? Beſides, the Scriptures do ſpeak abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly of the putting off of the Old man, and of the mortification of the ſinne of the nature, if there be no ſuch ſinne of the nature from <hi>Adam</hi> the root of corruption this whole work will be <hi>de non ente,</hi> for that which is not true in any ſenſe, cannot be mortified at all. And whither will this conceipt go at laſt? Further, the Saints have been deeply humbled for their birth ſinne. <hi>I was borne in iniquity, and in ſinne did my Mother conceive me: What is man that he ſhould be cleane, and he that is borne of a woman that he ſhould be righteons, &amp;c?</hi> If there be no ſuch ſinne at all, theſe confeſſions and humiliations will be <hi>de non ente.</hi> The Saints ſhall be humbled for a ſinne, and yet no ſuch ſinne is to be found. In for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times there were Thankſgivings for victories over enemies, which indeed and in truth were <hi>de non ente.</hi> But here we have Confeſſions and Humiliations of the ſame kinde, innumerable other abſurdities will enſue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the denyall of ſuch a truth, which as I may ſo ſay, is one of the firſt magnitude among the principles of the Faith. It were good that this learned man and others that are concerned in the point would timely think upon it, and be better adviſed before they go to farie. Againe, on the otherſide, I do not deny, that the points of original ſinne, and free-will, have been ſo handled in ſome ſyſtems of Divinity, Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb facs="tcp:168516:5"/>and Polemical Diſcourſes, that maintaines there hath been a want of conſideration, ſometimes a want of truth. What they bring out of the Scriptures (tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood) to prove the ſubſtance of the Doctrine is ſound and good, but what is alledged out of the Schoole-men to confirme the ſame, is not alwayes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenick: <hi>Pauls</hi> words do binde the conſcience alwayes, and at all times, but not alwayes as they are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the notions, in the tearms, and in the method of <hi>Aquinus.</hi> Suppoſe that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was now alive upon the earth, and it were laid as a task upon him to reade the whole body of the controverſie, as it now lyeth between the Dominicans and the Jeſuits, the Janſeniſts and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liniſts; ſuch a caſe being imagined, we may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what his judgement would be. As he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne one part for their dangerous ſetting up of free-will in derogation to the grace of God: ſo he would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together approve the other part for the mingling of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual truthes with ſtrange ſpeculations of Philoſophy, and with Metaphyſical quiddities, notions, and conceptions of their own commenting. Doubtleſſe he would finde many things in them that would not hold weight with the ſhekel of the Sanctuary. Among our ſelves alſo there are ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages that might have been uttered with greater caution. The Treatiſe of <hi>Luther de ſervo arbitrio</hi> is queſtionleſſe in it ſelf a worthy work, yet I think that <hi>Calvin</hi> in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Albertus Pighins</hi> did not ſpeak amiſſe, <hi>This alſo is true, ſome things which</hi> Luther <hi>wrote in a Scholaſtical kind of way, and in a leſſe popular ſtyle;</hi> Philip Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon <hi>by his prudent and dextrous bending it to the milder part, did more fitly apply to the ordinary capacity of men, and to the common uſe of life.</hi> Yet for all this in other places that great inſtrument of reformation doth ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſpeak of the freeneſſe of the grace of Chriſt, to every broken-hearted ſinner, that he doth ſatisfie all tender conſciences, and leave a ſolid foundation for the endeavour of man. Now every one cannot do this, for they that follow the aſperity and the rigour
<pb facs="tcp:168516:6"/>of <hi>Luther</hi> in ſome poſitions of his, cannot with the ſame ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al evidence ſet forth the grace of the Goſpel: And ſo it comes to paſſe that the harſhneſſe and the incongruity imputed to the doctrine, is indeed and in truth no other but the ſole defect of the Teacher. By right ſpiritual truths ſhould have ſpiritual Teachers, and ſpiritual hearers, and then a true judgment may be made of the real excellency and worth of them.</p>
            <p>Theſe things conſidered, I do intend to obſerve theſe rules in the enſuing diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, laying aſide all nice and curious ſpeculations, to retain ſo much of the termes of the School-men, that will ſerve onely to explaine the doctrine of the Goſpel, that ſpiritual things may be ſet forth in a ſpiritual manner.</p>
            <p>Secondly, my ſcope (the Lord enabling) ſhall be as to ſpeak the pure truth, ſo likewiſe the whole truth of God. When I ſpeak of the impurity of the natural birth, then I will take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſhew alſo how this doth referre immediately to the grace that doth regenerate; and when I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of <hi>Adam</hi> as a root of corruption to all his branches, I ſhall as carefully remember that this is a counterpane to Chriſt, being a root of grace and ſpiritual life alſo to all his branches. When it ſhall come in my way to mention the imperfection of man, and the ſpirituality of the command, I ſhall be as careful to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate that which doth anſwer to it <hi>(viz.)</hi> that all help is to be had from the Word of promiſe. When I ſhall ſay that a man hath no free-will by nature to that which is ſpiritually good, I ſhall be as willing to recite the true cauſe where the freedome is to be had, to wit, from the Son of God, <hi>if the Sonne will make you free, you ſhall be free indeed:</hi> Further, where I ſhall ſpeak of a certain number of elect which the Lord doth decree curtainly, and infallibly to bring to glory. I ſhall demonſtrate alſo that this neceſſity of infallibility doth not, nor cannot (whatſoever men may think) overturne the liberty of the will: For thoſe that the Lord hath certainly appointed to ſalvation, he will as certainly, firſt or laſt, ſooner or later, draw their wills ſo effectually that they ſhall freely chooſe the way and meanes that lead to ſalvation as the end. Thoſe and ſuch liketruths that are uſually miſunderſtood through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate
<pb facs="tcp:168516:6"/>handling, I ſhall endeavour to repreſent them in their true beauty: For as it is with the members of the body, ſo it is with theſe myſeries of ſalvation; Being conſidered apart, they ſeem to be deform'd, but being put together, there is an excellent correſpondence and ſymetry in the whole.</p>
            <p>Finally, according to our Saviours rule I ſhall endeavour (I hope without detriment to either part) to give to grace that which doth belong to her, and to the will that which doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to her; I would not take the leaſt dramme from the true grace of God, ſo on the otherſide I would have the will to work under the grace received. Theſe are the reaſons of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the treatiſe in theſe times.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ccaſion being given to me to read over your Treatiſe concerning <hi>the creation and the fall of Adam,</hi> I ſhall now endeavour to give you an account what I judge of your doctrine. I ſhall not ſtand upon every point, but onely upon that which is of ſpecial moment.

But I fear under the colour of this pretended Vindication you drive a deſigne to put Chriſt out of place. Through the whole body of your Treatiſe you ſtand upon the purity of nature, the denial of Original ſin, and the improvement of natural abilities. We will go in your method, and begin with your firſt Chapter.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> What were the cauſes that gave <hi>Adam</hi> his being?</head>
               <p>HEre you debate the efficient, material, formal, and final cauſes of that being which he had in the beginning, and tell us <hi>that God ſaw all that he had made, and behold it was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168516:9"/>very good,</hi> Gen. 1.32. From whence you draw this Concluſion, <hi>doubtleſſe theſe words were ſpoken to take off ſome future ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, or to prevent mens ſayings, that</hi> Adam <hi>conſiſted in creation of two ſorts of people, one being aſſigned for heaven, the other for hell. And lest we ſhould judge that God made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of him for damnation, at that time he aſſures us that he made all things very good.</hi> When I read this paſſage of yours, I do call to minde a kinde of torment uſed in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times: when the perſecutors would expoſe the bodies of Chriſtians to wilde beaſts, they did ſometimes cover and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe them with the skins of other living creatures. So do you here, and in other parts of your book with the doctrine of Gods free election. When you ſee that there is ſuch a Majeſty in the truth it ſelf that you cannot well oppoſe it, you do draw an ugly viſage and forme over it, to the end that you may baite and encounter it more eaſily at your own pleaſure. The Lords making all good in the beginning, doth not infringe the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome, and the non-election of others, if theſe things be rightly conſtrued. And therefore whether you conſider men in that firſt ſtate made after the image of God, or in that ſtate as fallen, in both theſe I conceive all mankinde to be equal. The difference of elect or non-elect is immanent onely in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, and election doth onely ſo farre forth begin to be manifeſt as men living under the meanes come to be called, juſtified, ſanctified by the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. We have no other way to take notice of election but this onely. For that ſaying of yours <hi>that</hi> Adam <hi>conſisted of two ſorts of people in creation, the one part being aſſigned for heaven, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for hell.</hi> We willingly acknowledge that the number of the elect were known to God before the foundation of the world, yet this difference between man and man in the Lords ſecret intention did make no difference between man and man in the creation or in the fall. The nature of all men, elect and others, was equally good before the fall, as it was equally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and depraved after the fall. As in the like caſe, <hi>Jeſſe</hi> was the father of many ſons, of which one was deſigned in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret counſel of God to rule the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> As they were the ſons of one parent they were all equal, made of one blood,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168516:9"/>partakers of the ſame education, though one was ſpecially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the Kingdome. So in the preſent caſe, the nature of all men may be equally good before the fall, all may have one and the ſame image of God, all may fall in one and the ſame parent, yet God may in a ſpecial manner intend to bring ſome to ſalvation, and to leave others voluntarily to run their own ruine; <hi>he may have mercie on whom he will have mercie, and he may have compaſſion on whom he will have compaſſion.</hi> You do then plainly impoſe upon us with your ſophiſtrie, when you fetch arguments from ſome temporal acts to overturne the Lords eternal Decrees. But this is a paſſage onely by the way, we will go to the next Chapter.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Wherein <hi>Adams</hi> abilities did conſiſt.</head>
               <p>HEre you define ability, <hi>that it is a fitneſſe in the ſubject commanded every way anſwerable to performe any action that the Creator is pleaſed to call the creature to,</hi> pag. 5. In this I do agree, that originally God did proportion the abilities of <hi>Adam</hi> to the commands that he gave him. I do alſo willingly acknowledge with you, that he had firſt a capaſſity to receive intelligence; ſecondly, directions; thirdly, abilities in preſent poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; and fourthly, time. But whereas you ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 7. <hi>that our Lord the Creator afforded all theſe aforenamed accommodations as a ſufficient means for every man to obey his commands.</hi> In this I beleeve you do not onely equal, but go beyond <hi>Pelagius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For you ſay in effect that man hath as great abilities after the fall, as before. But leſt that any may think that theſe are the conſequences of mine own making, and that they are not the true reſult of your doctrine, let him go to the fourteenth chapter of your book, and there let him ſee how you do expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite the queſtion. You propound the quere <hi>what</hi> Adam <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of his forfeiture after his death? and here you determine that his power was inwardly as great to keep the commands of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168516:10"/>God as before. You ſay if in that ſervice of God which</hi> Adam <hi>had to do he was compleatly furniſhed by God, why ſhould I judge that he would employ him in a more hard ſervice and not aford him ſutable accommodations? ſeeing God was as willing that his commands ſhould be obeyed after as he was before the fall. For I judge the work that God ſet</hi> Adam <hi>about before the fall he had ability to do after the fall if God had given him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to returne into the garden,</hi> page 110. Let any man who readeth theſe words judge in his own heart whether <hi>Pelagius</hi> himſelf could have ſpoken more to the derogation of the free grace of God in Chriſt, then you have done. To this if we adde the ſeveral paſſages in your Treatiſe concerning the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of nature, and the freedome of infants from origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin, and compare all together, we ſhall finde the whole te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of your doctrine to be manifeſtly deſtructive to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace. We will therefore endeavour on the contrary to ſhew the poſitive truth. And therefore, ſeeing God doth require obedience of man after the fall, I do freely aſſent that he doth give ſutable accommodation. But how? the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation doth not conſiſt in the preſence of any natural abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but in the promiſe ſince the fall there is an ability to obey the Lords commands, but that ability is out of man, in Chriſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: To him they muſt go to ſupply all their wants, and he muſt help them to performe all the duties enjoyned: If you ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the proportion of abilities to commands, then ſay that the ability is in Chriſt onely to be had, and we ſhall eaſily agree. <hi>He of God is made to us wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>In him all the treaſures of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge are hid,</hi> Col. 2.3. <hi>Of his fulneſſe have we all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived grace for grace,</hi> John 1.16. It ſhall never be denied by me, nay, I will maintain it, that now ſince the fall there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betwixt the ability and the command, but then the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity muſt be had from Chriſt onely, and the immediate ſupply of his Spirit. In this ſence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had abilities in a meet temper and correſpondence to his duties; for he ſaith, <hi>I can do all things through Christ that ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> Phil. 4.11, 12, 13. And in another place, <hi>my grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee, my ſtrength ſhall be ſeene in thy weakneſſe,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.7.8,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168516:10"/>9, But the way to come by this ability is not in your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to ſet up nature, but to die to a mans ſelf, and to be empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all natural abilities. <hi>Moſt gladly therefore will I glory in mine infirmities, that the power of Chriſt might rest upon me,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. The Authors of the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> do ſeeme to ſpeak more fairly for the grace of God then you do. They do not ſhun to affirme that we have all from Chriſt, and that of our ſelves we have not ability to think a good thought, and much to the ſame purpoſe. But by this affirmation of theirs how can they poſſibly agree with their own principles of the purity of nature? For where there is no depravation of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural birth, what need or what uſe is there of the grace of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation? They conceale themſelves, and you openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe your judgment: they ſeeme to ſpeak more fairly, but you are more true to the principles and poſitions of the Separate Churches.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Whether righteouſneſſe and holineſſe be Gods Image.</head>
               <p>HEre you endeavour to prove the Negative, to wit, that righteouſneſſe and holineſſe in man was not the image of God in the firſt creation. Becauſe this is not your own ſingle opinion, but alſo the doctrine of the thirty Congregations, who place <hi>the image of God onely in dominion over the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> we will debate the point more fully. And ſo much the rather, becauſe you did urge me at <hi>Earle-Shilton</hi> in <hi>Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Anno</hi> 1650. <hi>Decem.</hi> 26. before a multitude of people to anſwer this queſtion, <hi>what place of Scripture have you to prove that</hi> Adam <hi>had the Spirit of God, or that he was a ſpiritual man before his fall?</hi> I did then cite three ſeveral texts, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſence and import of all which is to ſhew that God made man after his own Image, and that this Image did principally conſiſt in ſpiritual and inward holineſſe.</p>
               <p>For that place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Come let us make man after our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168516:11"/>Image, in our own likeneſſe.</hi> There is none doth doubt but this is the ſpeech of the three perſons in Trinity. Onely the queſtion is wherein did this Image principally conſiſt. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate congregations and you alſo affirme, <hi>that it did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear onely in Dominion and Lordſhip over the creature;</hi> theſe words do immediately follow in the text, <hi>let them have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the fiſh of the ſea, over the fowle of the aire, and over the cattel, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</hi> But herein both they and you are deceived, for primarily and properly the Image of God was reſplendent in the conformity of the ſoule to the ſpiritual Law of God. Secondarily, the Image of God was reſplendent in that external priviledge of rule and dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the creature.</p>
               <p>Now that it may appear that the principal part of the Image of God is in inward holineſſe, and that the ſoule ſo inwardly and ſpiritually endowed, doth more lively expreſſe his ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, for this, reade that Scripture, <hi>Put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the Image of him that created him,</hi> Col. 3.10. Here note, what it is that the Apoſtle would have the Coloſſians to put on, <hi>Put on the new man.</hi> By this he doth mean the Chriſt-like and ſpiritual diſpoſition, ſet in immediate oppoſition to the old carnal diſpoſition of the fleſh, which they had already in good meaſure begun to put off. Secondly, the word (renewed) doth note a repaire or renovation of that which formerly was decayed. So the Pſalmiſt prayeth, <hi>Create in me a clean heart, and renew within me a right ſpirit,</hi> Pſal. 51.10. He doth pray for the returne of the ſame ſpirit which formerly he had, but now ſeemingly had loſt. <hi>So thy youth is renewed like the Eagles,</hi> Pſal. 103.5. As much in ſenſe as that he makes thee vigorous like an Eagle, who by caſting her beak and feathers, renews her former agility. And ſo in the preſent caſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is ſaid, <hi>Put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge,</hi> this noteth the repaire and renovation of that ſpiritual diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which <hi>Adam</hi> had, but loſt it by his fall. Thirdly, for the matter of the renovation, <hi>venewed in knowledge,</hi> doth ſignifie ſpiritual knowledge in the nature thereof, and that which comes from the Spirit of God as the cauſe. Fourthly, for the pattern
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168516:11"/>of the renovation, it is expreſſely ſaid, <hi>after the image of him that created him;</hi> Therefore the firſt man muſt be made in a ſtate of ſpiritual knowledge and holineſſe. If this be not ſo, how could the beleeving Coloſſians be renewed after this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample as the Prototype?</p>
               <p>Let us go to the next Scripture, <hi>that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in rigteouſneſſe and true holineſſe,</hi> Eph. 4.24. This Scripture alſo doth plainly ſhew that <hi>Adam</hi> had the Spirit of God before his fall. For firſt, why is it ſaid be renewed in the ſpirit of your minde? This implieth that we were ſometimes ſuch. Secondly, the expreſſion of <hi>righteouſnes and true holineſſe</hi> is oppoſed to feigned, and hypocritical ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thirdly, the whole tenour of the ſpeech is to this end, that the Epheſians ſhould put off the old <hi>Adam</hi>-like diſpoſition with all the deceitful luſts thereof; and that they ſhould put on the Chriſt-like nature which is renewed after the ſimilitude and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the image of God in man before the fall. The argument is thus grounded upon the text. <hi>What the Saints are by reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſuch Adam was by creation; But by renovation the Saints are juſt and holy:</hi> From all which we do conclude that <hi>Adam</hi> was a ſpiritual man, and had the Spirit of God before his fall.</p>
               <p>Now to the Scriptures let us adde a few reaſons. Firſt, it is a <hi>Maxime</hi> generally received, that the Law was made for man before his fall. Now how the firſt man could be conformable to ſo ſpiritual and divine a Law, and he himſelf be deſtitute of the Spirit, it is not within the compaſſe of my underſtanding to diſcerne. If we will argue <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> from the event, we muſt neceſſarily conclude that he muſt not only be ſpiritual, but alſo have a great meaſure of ſpirit to keep ſuch a divine and ſpiritual Law. Secondly, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>you hath he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that were dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes,</hi> Epheſ. 2.1, 2. If all be dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, this ſpiritual death muſt begin at the fall, and ſo by conſequence the firſt man muſt have the ſpirit, and ſpiritual life before his fall. For what is ſpiritual death, but a privation of the life of the Spirit of God? Theſe and many more reaſons might be brought to prove <hi>Adam</hi> to be a ſpiritual man as long as he ſtood in that ſtate in which God had placed him. Now let us hear your arguments to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:168516:12"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>You ſay that Adams righteouſneſſe and holineſſe was not in beleeving a Saviour, becauſe be was not in a loſt condition,</hi> pag. 10 Suppoſe all this be granted, that <hi>Adam</hi> was not to beleeve a Saviour, becauſe he was not in a lapſed or fallen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; how doth this prove that he was abſolutely carnal and deſtitute of the Spirit? He was to beleeve the Father as Lord Creator, he was bound to love him, to delight in him, and how could he poſſibly do all this but he muſt have ſome meaſure of Spirit? Therefore <hi>Adam</hi> had the Spirit, and was a ſpiritual man before his fall. You go on, and ſay, <hi>whatſoever qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the children of God have attained unto, in, and through Jeſus Chriſt their Lord, by remiſſion of ſinne, or the hope of a reſurrection, and the attainment of a better life, Adam was not capable of.</hi> To this I anſwer, though the difference may be in circumſtances, the ſubſtance is the ſame. For if you reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that <hi>Adam</hi> had in preſent poſſeſſion, and all that he might have had if he had ſtood; if you compare his whole ſtate with the ſtate of the Saints, with that which they have, and that which they ſhall have, you ſhall finde an excellent corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence betwixt both. For what if <hi>Adam</hi> was not capable of remiſſion of ſinne by Chriſts blood, it is all one if he be made in a ſtate free from ſinne? What if he was not capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation becauſe he had no pollution of nature? yet he was created with a pure and ſpiritual nature in original righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. What if he was not capable of the reſurrection from the dead, becauſe he died not a natural death? yet he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to eate of the tree of life, to keep himſelf from death, and ſo to live for ever. Your whole way of reaſoning is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fallacious, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſpiritual life every way the ſame in circumſtance, therefore he had not the ſpirit in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and being thereof. You go on and tell us, <hi>If men will hold this opinion, that righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God which the Lord created man in, and is not to be found there reſiding, then it is very requiſite that this holineſſe and righteouſneſſe be releaſed.</hi> But how do you prove that this holineſſe and righteouſneſſe did not reſide in <hi>Adam?</hi> If you ſhall ſay, that he was not capable of ſuch Evangelical holineſſe as is ſet forth in the ſecond Covenant; what of all this, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168516:12"/>the difference in circumſtance, he may have the ſame in ſubſtance. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I delight in the Law of the Lord after the inward man,</hi> Rom. 7.22. He had the ſame ſpiritual delight in the Law by Renovation, which <hi>Adam</hi> had before his fall by Creation; where then is the difference? <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had no rebellion, no law of the fleſh warring againſt the law of his minde, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had. There was the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of love in both, but in the one it was with the love of the fleſh, and with conflict with the love of the fleſh: but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was abſolutely free: He did not know by experience what it was to have the fleſh rebel againſt the ſpirit. Becauſe the Law requires entire obedience of bodie and ſoule, inward and outward, throughout all the parts of our life; becauſe it is ſpiritual it ſelf, and requires that the thoughts, words and deeds be ſpiritual; we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that the firſt man muſt be ſpiritual in a large degree, ſeeing the Law was tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and proportioned in the beginning to that ability he had.</p>
               <p>But you have another evaſion, you ſay, that <hi>at the Creation</hi> Adam <hi>was not made conformable to the Image of the Sonne, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had no ſuch lawes to be conformable to.</hi> Here you ſtill harp upon the ſame ſtring. Becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the ſame manner, therefore he had not the conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Image of Chriſt in ſubſtance. I pray you tell me the meaning of this Scripture, <hi>Come let us make man after our own Image. Is not this the ſpeech of Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt?</hi> You cannot deny it. No more can you deny that <hi>Adam</hi> was made after the Image of Chriſt as Lord Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. In this point we muſt neceſſarily ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> had the ſame Image of God, and the ſame ſpirit in the general nature of it, as the Saints have in the ſtate of Regeneration, only the difference lies in ſome circumſtances. He might alſo have the ſame faith in the general nature of faith; though it was impoſſible for him in that ſtate he ſtood to have juſtifying faith: Seeing he was abſolutely without the guilt of all ſin, he needed no pardon by Chriſts blood. Suppoſe all this be granted, that <hi>Adam</hi> was not to beleeve in a Saviour, becauſe he was not in a lapſed or fallen condition, yet all this doth not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168516:13"/>prove him to be a carnal man, or abſolutely deſtitute of the Spirit before his fall. He might beleeve in God the Father, as Lord Creator, to prevent that miſery which ſhould enſue by the fall. And to ſuch a kind of faith it is neceſſary, that he ſhould have ſome meaſure of ſpirit Upon this ground alſo we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him to be ſpiritual, and to have the Spirit before his fall.</p>
               <p>But whereas the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That God made man righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> you put off all with this ſhift, <hi>That God made Adam with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſtain or blemiſh in the beginning,</hi> page 13. This we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly confeſſe to be true, but it is not the whole, nor the principal part of truth. For uprightneſſe in the Scripture-lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, doth not only ſignifie a freedome from evil, but alſo a poſitive habit of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, and in this ſtate did God make man in the beginning.</p>
               <p>But admit that be granted, What do you gather from hence? you ſay, <hi>If thoſe that would have holineſſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, to be entituled the Image of God, and ſhall mean by it a condition without ſin, ſimply ſo conſidered, then the whole Creation of God might be ſaid to bear the Image of God,</hi> page 13. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your conſequence will not hold, That <hi>Adam</hi> was without ſin at the time of his Creation, it was from hence, that God made him a holy creature after his own Image: That other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are without ſin, is meerly from incapacity, ſeeing they have neither an underſtanding to know the Law of God, nor a will to embrace good or evil, therefore they cannot ſinne: For that ſpeech of yours, <hi>page</hi> 14. <hi>It will appear that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage which Adam did bear, wherein he repreſented God, lieth in ſome other place, where none of the creatures are in acapacity to come, it being beyond them all.</hi> Though in the general, I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this to be a ſolid truth, yet you do not rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it. What think you of that ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>There are ſome Eunuches that are ſo borne from their mothers wombe, and there are ſome made Eunuches of men, and there are ſome that have made themſelves Eunuches for the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 19.12. Here are three ſorts of Eunuches, but one ſort only is ſo made by grace, and the mortifying work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. So in the preſent caſe, the creatures were free from ſin as well as <hi>Adam,</hi> but their freedom was meerly from incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:168516:13"/>becauſe they were not able to receive a ſpiritual Law; And <hi>Adams</hi> freedome was from the holineſſe of that ſtate in which the Lord had made him. Therefore in the point of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſgreſſion, <hi>Adam</hi> was put into ſuch a ſtate as none of the creatures could come to.</p>
               <p>Next you enquire, <hi>Whether the Image of God did conſiſt in light?</hi> Theſe are your words, <hi>If the light that Adam had, was the Image, then it muſt be a light ſpiritual or natural, or both. Now that it was not the light of the Goſpel that</hi> Adam <hi>had, is clear, there being neither malady nor remedy which were in being in the time of this light,</hi> page 15. Though there was neither malady nor remedy at that time, yet he might have ſpiritual light in the ſubſtance thereof, and the Image of God might principally conſiſt in this. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, hath this expreſſion, <hi>renewed in knowledge after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of him that created him,</hi> Col. 3.10. This ſheweth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that man in the beginning was created after the Image of God, and that Image did chiefly conſiſt in the ſpiritual light that was in the underſtanding.</p>
               <p>But becauſe there is a great controverſie between the Arminians and us about the nature of this light, <hi>viz. Whether</hi> Adam <hi>had a power before his fall to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt?</hi> and becauſe this is a point pertinent to our purpoſe, I will briefly recite three Arguments uſed by <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinus,</hi> in his Anſwer to <hi>Du Moulin. Firſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Adam was not bound to beleeve in Chriſt, therefore he did not receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to beleeve in him: ſuch an ability would be unneceſſary and unprofitable, where there was no uſe of it at all.</hi> Chap. 11. ſect. 4.5. page 156. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Argument doth not hold; God did not require <hi>Adam</hi> to beleeve the Stories written in the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Books of <hi>Joſbua, Judges, Samuel, &amp;c.</hi> But will any man be ſo void of reaſon to argue, that he had no power to beleeve theſe Stories, in caſe they had been revealed to him? ſo God did not require <hi>Abraham</hi> to beleeve in Chriſt, as he was revealed and exhibited in the laſt diſpenſation of the promiſe: ſhall we therefore argue that he had not ability to beleeve, or that he had not the ſame ſpirit in ſubſtance which the Saints now have? He that doth ſo judge, let him anſwer
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:168516:14"/>the meaning of this Scripture, <hi>We having the ſame ſpirit of faith, according as it is written, I beleeved, and therefore have I ſpoken, we alſo beleeve, and therefore ſpeak,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. It is clear from hence, that the Patriarchs Prophets, and Apoſtles, had all of them the ſame ſpirit of faith in ſubſtance; yet all of them have not the ſame revelation of the promiſe, in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Corvinus</hi> ſaith, <hi>that before the fall the Goſpel was not credible, becauſe in the Goſpel a ſinner is commanded to believe himſelf to be a ſinner, and that by himſelf and his own works he cannot be ſaved, and that all ſalvation is placed in Chriſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour.</hi> And further he addeth. <hi>It was ſo far from man to be able to believe all theſe things, that he was then bound rather to believe the contrary, to wit, himſelf to be upright, and that he ſhould be bleſſed if he did perſiſt in his uprightneſſe.</hi> p. 154, 162, 164, 165. <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this we willingly agree, That the way to ſalvation, as now it is, doth differ very much from that ſtate wherein <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood. But the queſtion is not concerning the diverſitie or contrariety of the ſtates; but concerning the power and ability that <hi>Adam</hi> had, whether it be one and the ſame in ſubſtance with that which the Saints now have. White and black are two contrary colours, yet the ſame eye doth ſee both. Heat and cold are two qualities in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, yet they are tangible objects to one and the ſame ſenſe of ſeeling. So in the like caſe, though the Word of the Law, and the Word of the Goſpel, are two contrary wayes to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet there is nothing doth exclude, but they may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by one and the ſame ſpirit of faith. The Word may be one and the ſame in the general notion and nature of the Word, and it may be apprehended by one and the ſame ſpirit of faith, yet it may differ in circumſtance. But becauſe the force of the Argument doth lie in the contradictory nature of the two ſtates, we will come to inſtance in a caſe or two. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> before his fall could not ſhew mercie, if we look to the outward act or the performance of the duty, for where there is no miſery, what mercy can be ſhewed? ſhall we therefore argue that he had no ſuch affection in him as mercy? So in the like caſe, it is not compatible with the ſtate of the bleſſed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:168516:14"/>Angels to beleeve in a Chriſt to recover them out of their fall, for they that never fall, have no need of a recovery: what then ſhall we ſay that they have no ability to underſtand the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Goſpel? This cannot be, for ſo the Apoſtle reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>By them which have preached the Goſpel unto you, with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ſent down from Heaven, which things the Angels deſire to look into,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.12. Though the bleſſed Angels have no need of ſalvation by grace held out in the Goſpel, yet they have ability to underſtand it, they have a deſire to pry and gaze into it. So in the like caſe, though <hi>Adam</hi> had no need of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation before his fall by the Mediatour, yet he might have abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to underſtand that way of ſalvation, in caſe it had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Corvinus</hi> ſaith, <hi>that greater abilities are required to faith in Chriſt, then that ability which</hi> Adam <hi>bad before his fall. Anſw.</hi> I cannot ſee poſſibly how he can conſiſt with his own principles. For ſeeing he doth ſtand upon it in his Treatiſes againſt <hi>Moulin,</hi> page 159.165. <hi>that God doth proportion abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to commands;</hi> and ſeeing alſo he ſaith, <hi>that God did promiſe life to</hi> Adam, <hi>under the condition of moſt perfect and abſolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> By the poſition of theſe two, he muſt neceſſarily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme <hi>Adams</hi> abilities to be exceeding great before his fall. For ſeeing the work required was to yield ſuch a perfect obedience, as none elſe can perform ſince the fall but Chriſt alone; it muſt neceſſarily follow that <hi>Adam</hi> muſt have a large portion of ſpirit fitted for ſuch an employment. As in ſome Monuments of Antiquity, we do argue, how ſtrong ſuch a Prince was, that died many hundred yeares ago, from the greatneſſe and weight of his ſword: ſo from the ſpirituality of the Law given to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> before his fall, we do infer his abilities to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great. And thus much out of <hi>Corvinus</hi> his own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Now Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> let us return back again to you. And here, to deal plainly with you and the Churches that do depend upon your Inſtitution, I muſt tell you, that neither <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi> nor <hi>Corvinus,</hi> nor any other of that party, (to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) did ever ſpin ſuch a courſe thread as you do. For though they ſtand upon it, that <hi>Adam</hi> had not abilities to beleeve in Chriſt, &amp; to raiſe himſelf from his fal, yet none of them do utter
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:168516:15"/>ſuch ſpeeches as theſe, <hi>that Adam was altogether deſtitute of the Spirit of God, and that he was a meer carnal man before his fall.</hi> This to my underſtanding doth caſt a blurre upon the Creator himſelfe. Now I would intreat you to ſhew ſome further rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wherefore <hi>the Image of God did not ſtand in ſpiritual light. You ſay, it remaineth yet to prove that Adam had a ſupernatural light, Which they will never be able to do, unleſſe they will prove that he was ſet about ſome ſpiritual employments. For God giving light ſuitable to the employment he ſets his creature about, ſo ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably God proportions his light, that it might be just ſuitable for his works and no more,</hi> page 16. And for the works wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was employed, you tell us what they were, <hi>p.</hi> 17. <hi>He was to look after the Garden, to dreſſe and keep it, and to ſettle names and titles upon every creature, to eat and drink, with ſuch like works, as alſo to bear rule and dominion over the creatures.</hi> But Sir, in this point you are wonderful fallacious. For firſt, what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant have you to take the height, length and breadth of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> abilities from his preſent employments? There is many a true Chriſtian man in theſe times, that doth beleeve ſome truths, who hath ability to receive more if it would pleaſe the Lord to reveal them. So we may ſay in the like caſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Adam,</hi> he was able to receive more truths if they had been revealed, and to do more duties if he had been commanded. We are not abſolutely to tie and confine mens abilities to their preſent employments. Further, what ground have you to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that <hi>Adams</hi> employment was only in thoſe externals of keeping the Garden, and giving names to all cattel, &amp;c? Will you argue, becauſe you reade of no more, that therefore he had no more employment? Thirdly, ſuppoſe it ſhould be granted to you, that <hi>Adam</hi> was wholly taken up in theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions, this doth not prove that he was deſtitute of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual abilities. When the Apoſtle ſpeaks to ſervants, <hi>to obey their Maſters according to the fleſh, Eph.</hi> 6.5. There is no man doubts but he ſpeaks of an outward work, but when he ſaith, that they ſhould <hi>do it with ſingleneſſe of heart, as unto the Lord Chriſt, and not unto men:</hi> Here is the performance of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſervice in a ſpiritual manner. Even ſo, <hi>Adam</hi> might be ſpiritually employed in thoſe works of his, of dreſſing the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:168516:15"/>and of giving names to all cattel, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And thus we have tried your Reaſons, how far you are able to prove <hi>that the Image of God in Adam did not conſiſt in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and true holineſſe, and that he was not a ſpiritual man before his fall.</hi> This alſo is the doctrine of the Thirty Separate Congregations, who place the Image of God only in Lordſhip and dominion over the creature.</p>
               <p>Next you come to enquire, <hi>Whether the Image of God in dam did conſiſt in degrees of light?</hi> And here ſay you, <hi>if this be admitted, upon ſuch a ſuppoſition, not one in all the world can tell what it is to beare the title; for how can they tell of what height, length and breadth this knowledge ſhould be of?</hi> page 17.18. To eaſe you of all the pains of ſearching out the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of longitude or latitude; I ſay, preciſely at that time, when a man doth receive the true light of the Spirit, he doth reſume more or leſſe that Image of God which <hi>Adam</hi> loſt. And look by how many degrees this light doth increaſe, by ſo many degrees proportionably this Image of God is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh very properly to the purpoſe, <hi>We all with open face beholding as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.19. Here theſe foure things are to be noted. Firſt, the pattern or the <hi>Idea, we are changed into the ſame Image,</hi> to wit, into the Image of the Lord Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Secondly, the degrees or the ſeveral ſtages: <hi>we are changed from glory to glory.</hi> Thirdly, the mean or the inſtrument of the change, <hi>we all with open face beholding as in a glaſſe,</hi> the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt revealed in the Goſpel, by prying into it, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing upon it we are altered and tranſlated into the ſame image. Fourthly, the principal cauſe of the tranſmutation, <hi>even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> by the inward work of the Spirit men come to be enlightned, and ſo more and more to put on the Image of God: From theſe ſeveral particulars it is clear, that the Regenerate are renewed after the Image of Chriſt, and the excell noy thereof doth ſtand in ſpiritual light. And this light in ſubſtance we ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> had before his fall. They are the words of the Apoſtle, as we have formerly ſaid, <hi>renewed in knowledge, after the Image of him who created him.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:168516:16"/>
               <p> Further, you endeavour to ſhew that the Image of God did not ſtand in holineſſe: You ſay, <hi>If it had layen in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe never ſo Evangelical and ſpiritual, ſurely the woman that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in the Lord Jeſus would not have been deprived of that title, but the Apoſtle expoſtulateth the cauſe of the difference,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.7. <hi>where he clearly aſcribeth that title.</hi> ſcil. <hi>the Image of God to reſide only in preheminence,</hi> page 23. But this will not ſerve your turne neither, for when God created the woman in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſhe was not only created after his Image in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and true holineſſe, but ſhe was alſo created in a ſtate to have Lordſhip over the creature. Theſe are the words of the Text, <hi>So God created man in his own Image, in the Image of God created be him, male and female created he them. And God ſaid unto them, be fruitful and multiply, and repleniſh the earth, and ſubdue it, and have dominion over the fiſh of the ſea,</hi> Geneſ. 27.28. Theſe words were not only ſpoken to the firſt man, but to the firſt woman alſo, and to all mankinde whether male or female that ſhould come of them, that they ſhould people the world and bring it in ſubjection. If this be ſo, the man and the woman were both created in that ſtate to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence over the Creation. And for the words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, they do not deny the woman to be made after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, though this Image was more immediately and fundamentally in man the head and lord of the Creation; If you look narrowly into the text, you ſhall finde a reaſon wherefore man doth more immediately bear the Image of God, and is a more lively repreſentative of his Majeſty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the woman was made for the man as an help meet for him. Now we proceed to the next Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Wherein that Image did conſiſt that God did create <hi>Adam</hi> in.</head>
               <p>IN this Chapter you endeavour to prove that the Image did conſiſt in dominion and rule over the creature, <hi>page</hi> 24.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:168516:16"/>In this I will be no adverſary to you. But the queſtion is, whether did that Image only or principally conſiſt in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned dominion, as the Separate Congregations, and you in this Treatiſe do labour to prove. This I deny.</p>
               <p>For the words that follow, <hi>Let them have dominion over the fiſh of the ſea, and the fowl of the aire,</hi> they are ſpoken only to the vulgar capacity of the Reader. For in the ordinary way the Image of God is more viſible and eaſie to be diſcerned in the external dominion over the creature, then in the ſpiritual and inward endowment of the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Further, whereas you ſay, <hi>That Magistrates in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are called gods, and that in reſpect of their dominion they do carry the Image of God,</hi> page 24, 25. From theſe words of yours you may be condemned, for it is too apparent in the next Chapter, that you vilifie and ſlight all kinde of Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and make it a matter of nothing. And for the proof out of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Revelation,</hi> you do ſhew your rudeneſſe in that kinde of learning. <hi>By the head of gold</hi> (ſay you) <hi>Daniel plainly ſheweth to the King, thou art the head of gold. This King was an image in reference to his preheminence, otherwiſe he had not differed from other men,</hi> page 26. That <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was a King, and a mighty King, and that in his Kingly power he did carry the Image of God, I do willingly confeſſe. But I pray you tell me, whence is it that you call him an image? To ſay the truth, he is typed and ſet forth by ſome part of the image. By the ſame Law you may call the Counties of <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> and <hi>Cornwall</hi> a Map of all <hi>England:</hi> whereas theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys are deſcribed as ſome parts in the Mappe. Further, if we ſhould grant that the Babylonian Empire in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> might be ſaid to be the image by a Synechdoche, becauſe it is ſome part of the image; what is this to the Image of God; and to the Creation of man after his Image? For the image ſpoken of in the text, it is only a type and a figure which the Lord did uſe to ſet forth the foure Tyrannical Empires, which in their ſeveral ſucceſſions one after another ſhould afflict the Church. Theſe foure great Empires be doth ſet forth by ſo many beaſts, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. as they are deſcribed by the foure regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and parts of the image, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. But what reference hath
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:168516:17"/>this deſcription to the Image of God in the Creation of man, I cannot diſcern: I think as good a reſemblance may be found between a ſhepherds dog, and the dog ſtarre, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two images which you parallel and compare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But if to mend the matter you ſhall ſay, <hi>that Rulers are ſignified by the ſeveral parts and regions of the image;</hi> I will anſwer, in propriety of ſpeech, the Lord by this figure doth repreſent ſo many ſucceſſions of tyrannie rather then of lawful dominion, and why he ſhould do this by the foure parts of the body of man is from his own inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Neither is that other place more fitly alledged out of the book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> for though it be true in the general, that Rulers in reſpect of their preheminence do carry the Image of God; yet how can you conclude anything from that text, <hi>The Dragon gave life to the image?</hi> Rev. 13.15. The ſcope of the Spirit in this Prophecy, is mainly concerning the ſufferings of the Church under two formes of Roman dominion, under the tyranny of <hi>Rome</hi> Imperial, and <hi>Rome</hi> Papal, and ſo it was when the perſecuting Empire was deſtroyed, there was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation and repaire of that Majeſty, and a reviving of it, as it were, from the dead. This the Spirit doth expreſſe, when he ſaith, that the beaſt had a wound in one of his heads: this wound was cured, and the ſecond beaſt made an image to the beaſt that had received a wound in one of his heads. The ſcope of all is to ſhew the repaire of the Roman Tyranny in the Popes, that was formerly loſt in the <hi>Ceſars.</hi> Now how do you gather from hence that Magiſtrates do carry the image of God, in reſpect of their authority? Indeed, in theſe words there is mention made of an image, but none of Gods Image: of the image of the beaſt, which had received a wound in one of his heads. Again, here is mention made of a vice-gerent, but none of Gods Vice gerents upon the earth. <hi>The Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon gave him his power, ſeat and great authority.</hi> Now Sir, I leave it to any ordinary underſtanding, to judge what woful havock is here made of the Word of God. I do the more willingly put you in minde of theſe things, becauſe now a days ſo many bold and ignorant men intrude themſelves into the place of the Miniſtry, and take ſo much upon them to expound
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:168516:17"/>the <hi>Revelation, Daniel, Canticles,</hi> and other hard Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Concerning the power that God gave <hi>Adam,</hi> and what is the definition thereof.</head>
               <p>TO the end that we may underſtand what power <hi>Adam</hi> loſt, and what he retained, you do well in the beginning to define what his power was. You ſay, <hi>you do not take power for ability, or the uſe of ability, but for a word of command, iſſuing from the great Commander, with reference to man: or a lawful Commiſſion given to men, whereby they are enabled to justifie their actions, in caſe they neither adde nor diminiſh.</hi> And then you conclude, <hi>ſo much command a man hath from God, ſo much power he hath of God,</hi> page 29, 30. Here you ſeem to me to affect a way by your ſelfe. For though ſometimes power is taken for authority, for that which a man may warrantably and lawfully do, yet I think in the preſent caſe, when you ſpeak of the power which <hi>Adam</hi> had before his fall, it had been more proper to inſiſt upon his ability, what he was able to act according to the Law that was given to him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we take power in the latter ſenſe. <hi>Adams</hi> freedom did not ſtand ſo much in what the Lord did poſitively command him, as in that which he did not preciſely and ſtrictly forbid him. And therefore you muſt needs erre in the definition of that power that <hi>Adam</hi> had before his fall. But theſe improper ſpeeches of yours might paſſe, if you did not turne them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Civil power. Theſe are your words, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>If the ſoul muſt be ſubject to ſuch Powers as are the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, and there be no Powers but Gods Ordinances, then Gods Word or his Command are his Ordinances.</hi> And from hence you infer, <hi>if Rulers come as Gods Ministers, they muſt produce his Word for the power of Ordinances,</hi> page 30. Here I would have you to aſſigne the difference between the power appertaining to a Magiſtrate, and the power belonging to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:168516:18"/>private man; for if that be true, as you ſay, <hi>that Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are to be obeyed, ſo far forth only as they bring the Word;</hi> I pray you tell me, muſt not every man be obeyed upon the ſame termes? what do you make then of the power of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate? when <hi>Pilate</hi> boaſted, <hi>Knoweſt thou not that I have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to crucifie thee, and power to releaſe thee?</hi> The Lord made him this anſwer, <hi>Thou haſt no power, but it is given thee from above,</hi> John 19 10 11. It is plain then, that <hi>Pilate</hi> as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and a Judge had a power given him of God. Now then if that be true which you ſay, that the Magiſtrate hath no power but the Word it ſelf, then it will follow that theſe are co-incident termes. For to ſpeak properly, the power of the Magiſtrate and the Word are not one and the ſame, but the Authority of the Magiſtrate doth depend upon the Word, from whence it hath its Original and Inſtitution. You go on, and argue, <hi>Are not all men Gods creatures, if ſo, how cometh it to paſſe that one ſhould be in ſubjection to anothers will, and that upon ſuch ſore puniſhment?</hi> page 30, 31. Here in theſe words you come very near the doctrine of the <hi>Levellers:</hi> Can you make no diſtinction between ſubjection to the lawful power, and mans illegal will? And then turning off from this digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, you conclude, <hi>that the Command of God is the Power, and therefore ſo far as the Lords Command did extend, ſo much power Adam had.</hi> But for this matter we are content to let you paſſe with your own peculiar way of expreſſion. Let us now ſee how you deſcribe <hi>Adams</hi> entertainment in the Garden.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Adams entertainment in the Garden.</head>
               <p>IN this Chapter you diſcourſe how <hi>Adam</hi> was placed in the Garden, how <hi>Eve</hi> was made an helper meet for him, and how the Lord brought all the creatures to him, that he might give them their ſeveral names and titles. Becauſe theſe are
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:168516:18"/>Plain Scripture-truths, I will not be an adverſary to you here. But then two queſtions are to be demanded; Firſt, whether was his chief emploiment in theſe externals? Secondly, whether he did act in them as a meer carnal man?</p>
               <p>For the firſt, if you ſhall ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> was only employed in theſe externals, then ſhew why was the Law of God written in his heart? None can imagine but that it was engraven and written there, to that end, that he ſhould yield proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable obedience: he had ſpiritual abilities that he might be proportionable to a ſpiritual Law. If you ſhall deny this, you will unavoidably be caſt upon that rock, that <hi>Adam</hi> had the Law put into his heart for no uſe or end at all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though he was taken up in externals, in giving names to all creatures, and in tilling of the ground, yet in this you muſt look upon him as a man that was ſpiritual, able to do theſe things in a ſpiritual manner. Theſe two points I thought good to re-minde you of, becauſe you did a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore affirme that <hi>Adam</hi> was a meer carnal man before his fall, and that his occupation and employment was only in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. Let us go to the next Chapter.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Free will in its nature unfolded.</head>
               <p>HEre in the beginning, <hi>you define free-will to be a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful putting forth of thoſe abilities which the Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us to action.</hi> And this you prove by many Scripture-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to clear the nature of freedome. By this account it will follow, that a natural man, as ſuch, without the help of the Spirit hath no free-will at all: he is ſo far from a free, voluntary, and cheerful putting forth of abilities, that in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things he is utterly void and deſtitute of all ability. But as in the former Chapter you had your digreſſion to turne out againſt the Magiſtrate, when you ſpake of the power of <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall; ſo now ſpeaking of his free-will you have your vagaries and excurſions againſt the Miniſtry. Theſe are your words, <hi>Paul preached the Goſpel freely, he ſtood not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:168516:19"/>upon ſuch</hi> punctilio's <hi>to have the tenth of the labours of the people,</hi> page 40. The <hi>Separate Congregations</hi> alſo agree with you here. <hi>For,</hi> ſay they, <hi>the maintenance of the Miniſters which labour in the Word of God, ought to be the free and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table benevolence, or the cheerful contribution of thoſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge themſelves members of the ſame fellowſhip,</hi> page 22. And the ground they have to prove it is from that place of the Apoſtle, <hi>while by the experiment of this miniſtration they glorifie God for your profeſſed ſubjection unto the Goſpel of Chriſt, and for your liberal diſtribution unto them, and unto all men,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.13. It is clear that the Apoſtle in theſe words ſpeaketh of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributions, and the voluntary benevolences of the Churches to the neceſſities of the poor Saints at <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> But by what Logick the brethren of the Separation can apply this to the maintenance of the Miniſtry, in the time of the New Teſtament, for my part I cannot diſcern. Sure I am, when you and they ſhall go about to make the people free-willers, in ſo doing you will make a ſervile and a ſlaviſh Miniſtry. As for the due in the payment of the tenth, it doth as truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to the Miniſters, as any mans poſſeſſion or inheritance doth belong to him. And therefore if either you or any man elſe ſhall endeavour to take away the tenth from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, it is all one as to endeavour to take away the proprietie from other men. Having gone ſo far along with you in your digreſſion, let us now come to that freedome of will which <hi>Adam</hi> had before his fall. And here I do agree with you, that he had libertie to put himſelf forth chearfully and freely to action, by vertue of ſuch abilities as he had received from God; yet when you come to the negative part, to pluck that down which is built by other men, you plainly ſhew, that your definition is not proper to the caſe in hand. For thus you conclude, <hi>Now ſome have conceived that free will had been a mans being, left to his choice whether he would do the Will of God or no. But I know no ſuch freedom given by God, that a man ſhould have liberty to diſpoſe of himſelf, unleſſe you will call that freedom of will, which a man is prohibited from upon penalties of death; but God gives no man freedom to ſin, but preventions;</hi> To this I anſwer, though the Lord gave <hi>Adam</hi> no freedom to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:168516:19"/>ſin, but rather tied up his liberty by a contrary command, yet it is a ſure rule, that he made him in ſuch a pendulous eſtate that he might ſtand or fall. And though in that ſtate he had freedom and power to will that which was good, nay, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to put forth his ability to act, yet for all this, his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was but mutable, he might fall if he would, as appeareth by the event. Now that the libertie of <hi>Adam</hi> did ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two, between the chooſing of the good, and the refuſing of the evil, it is clear from the ſignification of the two trees. The Tree of life ſignified what happineſſe he ſhould enjoy if he ſtood; the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, what miſery ſhould attend him if he fell. Therefore the liberty of <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood betwixt chooſing of the good, and refuſing of the evil.</p>
               <p>For your definition of free-will, <hi>that it is a chearful iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth to action by vertue of abilities received, this might in ſome ſort be applied to the bleſſed Angels and Saints in the ſtate of glory.</hi> For though they be eſtabliſhed and confirmed in their holy and happy eſtate that they cannot fall, yet they do moſt freely, voluntarily and chearfully put forth their abilities to the glory of God: but <hi>Adams</hi> freedom was otherwiſe for the trial of his obedience. He was made in a mutable and changeable condition, in which he might ſtand or fall by his own free election, not only becauſe the Lord would be obey ed by a free choice, but alſo that through his fall, a door might-be opened to the ſending of the Sonne, and that ſalvation might be had upon termes of grace only, to the fuller decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the glory of God.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> How far God aſſiſted Adam, or aſſisteth other men, that they might be ſuch free-willers as hath been deſcribed.</head>
               <p>TO the performance of duty you tell us, that <hi>God doth give, first, a capacity to underſtand; ſecondly, ability to perform;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:168516:20"/>thirdly, time; fourthly, he doth uſe exhortations and reproofs.</hi> And then you adde, <hi>that he giveth theſe rich accommodations as a ſufficient means, for all men to obey every one of his commands; and he goeth no further for effecting any mans actions in the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> page 42, 43. In theſe words of yours you do plainly eliminate and extinguiſh Gods peculiar grace by and through which he doth infalliblie and certainly carry on his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſalvation. But that we may joyne iſſue with you, we do freely yield, that God giveth greater abilities and helps to men then they ordinarilie make uſe of. Yet I know no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world you have to confound the abilities that <hi>Adam</hi> had before the fall, with the abilities that every man now hath in the ſtate of nature. Again, if you look upon all men as lapſed or fallen, how can you affirm that the abilities which the Lord giveth are equal to all. Is not this contrary both to Scripture and experience? you tell us how far God goeth with every man in the conferring and beſtowing abilities upon him, and then peremptorily and magiſterially determine, <hi>that he doth not go further to the effecting of any mans actions in the world.</hi> Thirdly, it is a point well worth the ſearching, what you mean by theſe abilities. <hi>Pelagius</hi> himſelf did ſtand much upon this, that he was a patron and a great friend to the grace of God. But how did he maintain it? he had a clancular and a reſerved ſenſe, he conceived the minde, will, and other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral abilities to be the gifts of God, and called them by the name of his free grace. This <hi>Augustine</hi> of old did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be true in the general, but he did blame him for his obſcuring and darkning the inward ſpecial grace of God, through which he doth effectually work upon the hearts of men. And I would we had not too much cauſe given to us to judge the ſame of you. For though you ſpeak much of the ability which God doth give, yet when all is done, you go no further then the natural faculties. Let any man conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what you have written concerning this point, in the denial of Original ſin, in the advancement of the purity of nature, in the emprovement of natural abilities, in aſſerting that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> ability was as good after the fall as it was before. By the collation of all theſe, let any man judge whether you do
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:168516:20"/>not advance nature, and depreſſe the grace of God; and whether in theſe aſſertions &amp; affirmations of yours, you are not a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Pelagian.</hi> You cite that place, Iſ. 5 <hi>Judge I pray you now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt me and my vineyard, what could I have done more to my Vineyard that I have not done?</hi> From whence you infer, <hi>Where are thoſe diſputers against God, that will ſay be made a man able to oppreſſe and do unrighteouſly, and left him destitute of ability and power to do thoſe things which he commanded.</hi> Becauſe this text, as formerly, ſo now, is much alledged by the Patrons of free-will; I ſhall endeavour the more diligently to ſhew the meaning thereof; I ſee no reaſon from the Lords peculiar bounty to the Jewiſh Church, that we ſhould conclude ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally that he gives the ſame ability to every man, in the ſame degree and the ſame meaſure, and that in point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and turning to God. There is nothing in the parable, but (if the Scriptures rightly be compared) you ſhall finde the truth of the thing will anſwer the <hi>emphaſis</hi> of the words. For that expreſſion, <hi>What could I have done more to my Vineyard that I have not done?</hi> the truth of this will appear, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider all along what God had done for them, in chuſing them above all the people of the world, what he had done for them in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the wilderneſſe, in bringing them into the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> how he had been preſent with them in all the times of the Judges and the Kings, how he had delivered them from great dangers, how he had taught them by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how he had raiſed up Prophets in ſeveral ſucceſſions of time to turne them from the evil of their evil ways; and many ſuch like paſſages of his grace and goodneſſe to that people, which plainly ſeal the truth of that ſaying, <hi>What could I have done more to my Vineyard which I have not done?</hi> This is true in particular of the Jewiſh Church. ſet forth by the figure of the Vineyard: but how doth it prove the queſtion that doth lie before us? your task is to ſhew the general aſſiſtance that God giveth to every man to make him a free-willer, yet here I do in ſenſe agree with Dr. <hi>Mayer</hi> and others upon the place, <hi>that at ſeaſons the Lord by ſending in of light doth ſo looſen the will that is bound, that then a man hath ſome power to will that which is good.</hi> And hereupon they inferre,<note place="margin">☜</note> 
                  <hi>that the fault
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:168516:21"/>is in man himſelf.</hi> For although by nature he be not able to will the good, yet when he heares outwardly, and the Spirit moves inwardly, he is able to go the next ſtep, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is in this, that he doth not act according to the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity adminiſtred. As for that ſaying of yours, <hi>that God giveth a man ability to oppreſſe, but not to obey his Commands:</hi> This is none of our poſitions, but it is one of your calumnies. We hold that God hath put ſo much light into the heart of the Gentiles, to know that they muſt not ſteal, that they muſt not defraud or oppreſſe: the Lord alſo doth give them power to act according to their light in theſe and ſuch like outward moralities. This is clear from the firſt and ſecond Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes;</hi> and it is evident alſo by that Scripture, that God was indeed much diſhonoured by their not emproving their abilities which he had beſtowed upon them, to the bringing forth of ſuch actions of obedience as he had required of them. He was angry with them becauſe they did not walk after the light, becauſe they held the truth in unrighteouſneſſe, becauſe by oppreſſion and other ſinnes they did not anſwer the Law written in their heart. Though in theſe externals the Gentiles had abilities ſome way propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the Commands, yet in the caſe of true repentance, and turning to God, the ſame Apoſtle doth drive the Gentiles from all confidence and dependance upon natural ability. The whole tenour of his ſpeech is to ſhew, that the proper uſe of the light which God giveth, is primarily and immediately to help a man to judge himſelf, and in judging, to ſee his owne emptineſſe, that ſo in the ſenſe of his own miſery he may make out for mercy. The whole ſcope then of the Apoſtle is to ſhew, that Jewes and Gentiles are all under ſin, that they have no ability of their own: and the end is to drive them to a Chriſt to make up all.</p>
               <p>Next you go to the Parable of the Talents, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. You reaſon, <hi>Our Saviour comes and bears witneſſe to the world that he deſires no more encreaſe then the benefit of what he had firſt given means ſufficient to bring forth, no more then was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the ſeed he had firſt ſowen; if one Talent, then the encreaſe of one,</hi> verſe 18. <hi>The ſlothful man hides the Lords
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:168516:21"/>treaſury, but</hi> verſe 30, <hi>the Lord preſents to us what courſe he will take with ſuch ſervants who uſe ſuch kind of ſayings (as too many do in theſe dayes) that God would be gathering where he ſcattereth not: but that muſt needs be a lye, for what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure could the Lord himſelf take in any ſuch increaſe where himſelf is not the planter?</hi> page 45. I have often found this Scripture cited by the Arminians, yet among them all I never met with any that made ſo corrupt a uſe of it as you do. Not many years ſince the learned <hi>Chamier,</hi> treating of the point of free-will, did endeavour to ſhew the difference betwixt the Philoſophers and the Jeſuites; <hi>They</hi> (ſaith he, meaning the Jeſuites) <hi>do admit ſome kind of grace, which never entered into the thought of</hi> Ariſtotle; <hi>they acknowledge the corruption of nature by ſinne, which the Philoſophe's did never ſo much as dreame of, Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>ſect</hi> 9. If this Author were now alive, I would gladly know what difference he would ſet betwixt the Philoſophers and the Brethren of the Separation, who hold that infants are free from all natural corruption; what difference he would ſet betwixt <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Ethical Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie and your Moral Divinitie, when you teach that <hi>Adams</hi> abilities were as good after the fall as they were before. But now let us come to clear the Parable of the Talents. Firſt, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by ſufficient means you underſtand onely the ſupply of the Spirit of Chriſt, how can you juſtifie this to be a true interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that Chriſt requires no more encreaſe then the benefit of what he had firſt given ſufficient means to bring forth? Will you ſay that it is abſolutely neceſſary to have the ability in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſion before the command can be given? If this be your opinion, you muſt needs block up the right and the true way of bringing a ſoul to Chriſt. We preach the Law in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual nature of it to a natural man, to what end is all this, but that by the ſight of his own emptineſſe, by the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the guilt of ſinne he may look after a Chriſt, firſt, to juſtifie and to pardon; ſecondly, to ſanctifie and to cleanſe the pollution of his nature? We do not preach the Law to him, ſuppoſing that he hath ability, but the immediate end of our preaching is by and thorough the inward working of the Spirit to empty him of all ability, that ſo he may look to the promiſe,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:168516:22"/>where true ability is onely to be had. For the words of the Parable, <hi>that he gave to every man according to his ability, ver.</hi> 15. We are not ſtrictly to adhere to the letter, as though the Lord doth give his grace according to every mans natural ability, but it is ſpoken after the manner of men; he giveth his grace in a different meaſure, to ſome more, and to ſome leſſe; yet all the ability is from Chriſt himſelf. And therefore when he that received one Talent accuſed the Lord for an hard man, <hi>for reaping there where he did not ſowe;</hi> the anſwer was, <hi>thou ſhouldest have given my money to the exchanger:</hi> that is, though thou hadſt no ability of thine own, yet if thou hadſt gone to the exchanger, to the Promiſer, he was able to make profit of the money, he was able to help thee with forreign ſupply where thine own natural and domeſtical ability was wanting. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas you affirm, <hi>that there are many in theſe dayes that uſe ſuch hard kinde of ſayings, that God would be gathering where he ſcattereth not, and that one day he will call ſuch ſervants to account; I do acknowledge, as heretofore, ſo now, there are more then too many who do neglect their talent, and cast the blame upon God himſelf.</hi> But your aime is not ſo much at theſe, as againſt others who oppoſe free-will, and your way of ſetting up the natural ability of man. Though ſome paſſages in their writings are hard, yet if you would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare one thing with another, you ſhould find that they do ſpeak of abilities that do anſwer duties; of a word of promiſe that anſwereth the word of command; of the fulneſſe of Chriſt ſet in oppoſition to the ſinfulneſſe and miſery by <hi>Adam.</hi> Doctor <hi>Twiſſe</hi> diſputing againſt the Arminians, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>errat.</hi> 9. <hi>pag.</hi> 211. doth of all others ſeeme to tread ſomething hard, yet he doth ſhew many pithie reaſons wherefore the Lord may give a command where there is a want of abiliy. <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>men are too apt to truſt in their own work to bring them to ſalvation; therefore that they may know the common conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Original ſinne, and thereupon the impotency and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that hath enſued to all good, the Lord taketh this courſe to ſhew them their miſery. Secondly he addeth theſe words, If by the grace of God we know our ſelves to be no way fit or able to do thoſe things which the Lord commandeth, yet
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:168516:22"/>by his juſt counſel he doth command us, and by his commands he doth ſhew what we are indebted to him as Lord Creator, and that which we are not able to performe our ſelves we may beg help of him that we may performe it. And from the words of</hi> Auguſtine <hi>he inferreth that therefore the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us that which is impoſſible, that we may know what to aske of him, for that which is impoſſible to be done by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is not impoſſible to be done by grace.</hi>
                  </q> And to come to you more particularly, he addeth, <q>
                     <hi>It is not neceſſary that we ſhould have this grace before the Lord doth ſignifie and make known to us by his commands what our duty is.</hi>
                  </q> And ſo in the cloſe of all in the end of the Section he concludeth. <q>
                     <hi>And therefore though they could not</hi> (ſpeaking of the Jewiſh Church compared to the Vineyard) <hi>rightly uſe thoſe outward means by their natural abilities, yet they could by the helps of grace.</hi>
                  </q> So farre the Authour aforenamed. I have ſtayed the longer upon this point, that you may ſee that they who have moſt ſtrongly aſſerted the grace of God, are no enemies to the endeavour of man, and though they do teach every where that there is a want of ability to performe the commands, yet they ſhew alſo where the true ability is to be had, to wit, in the Lord Chriſt, and in the freeneſſe of his grace. And this is the true meaning of the parable of the Talents and of the uſe of them, and how in the caſe of non-ability we ſhould go to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the great exchanger.</p>

               <p>IN this Chaptuer you diſpute the point very largely that God giveth ability to act, but not the action. For the clearing of the matter, I will firſt ſtate the queſtion, and then I will try the ſtrength of your reaſons ſo farre forth as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:168516:23"/>they are of force againſt us. For the ſtate of the queſtion, there are four principal opinions. The firſt is of them that ſtand upon the power of nature, as the Pelagians of old, and you now endeavour to prove that mans ability is as good ſince the fall, as it was before. The ſecond is of them who do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the need of grace to heale the ſinfulneſſe of nature, but (as they define it) it is ſuch a general, weak and common grace, that it is only made efficacious in and by the concurrence of the will. This doctrine is maintained by the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians.</hi> The third is of thoſe who ſtand ſo much for the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of grace, that they wholly take away the endeavour of man. The <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> in theſe dayes are ſo for the immediate workings of the Spirit, that they make us paſſive, as though we were meere blocks and ſtones in the work of our ſalvation. The fourth is of thoſe who turn from theſe dangerous extrems, they hold a need of the grace to carrie on the whole work to ſalvation, yet ſo, that man is a free agent, who works under the grace, or by the help of grace received. This is the doctrine of our Divines. And therefore when <hi>Bellarmine</hi> layeth it to our charge, as though we ſhould teach that <hi>men are moved as meere inanimate and dead inſtruments.</hi> Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> maketh this anſwer, <hi>Bellarminus hic luctatur cum larvâ à ſeipſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſictâ, Bellarmine doth here fight with a man of ſtraw of his own making,</hi> Ameſ. Tom. 4. cap. 3. Sect 4. And truly Sir, when you ſtand ſo much upon the point, that obedient actions are not the gift of God, if you think that we hold that men are not free agents under grace, in this you fight againſt your own ſhadow, and not againſt us. Your arguments, ſome of them, if they were rightly alledged, would be of good uſe againſt the <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts</hi> of theſe latter times.

                  <p>This Argument is of force againſt them who hold that God doth work in us as inanimate creatures. For where actions are wanting, I cannot ſee but by the tenour of this doctrine the defect will lie upon God, and to this paſſe are more then too many brought in theſe dayes. For, do they not ſay, <hi>are not all the Promiſes of God our portion? what if we neglect ſuch Ordinances, ſuch means of ſalvation? are we not above all? Are not all the Promiſes of God ours, for keeping, guiding and preſerving of us? We will not look to</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollo, <hi>or the outward meanes, but to Christ himſelf to do all in us and for us.</hi> Thus men ſeparate Gods Promiſes from his wayes and preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions. But let this be obſerved, though God doth all by his Spirit, yet he doth it mediately by inſtruments, and our own endeavour is not to be excluded. For inſtance, to ſhew the firſt work of grace upon the heart, let us conſider that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Apoſtle, and there we ſhall ſee the concurrence of Gods grace, and mans endeavour. <hi>In meekneſſe inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, and that they may recover themſelves out of the ſnare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.25, 26. Though gain-ſayers are the furtheſt off from the Kingdome of Chriſt and of God: the Apoſtle would have a Miniſter of the Goſpel to ſhew all meekneſſe and patience, and brotherly to exhort them? and here layes this for a ground of encouragement, <hi>Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture God will give them repentance to come to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the truth.</hi> The Miniſter of the Goſpel muſt ſet forth the truth in evidence and demonſtration, and leave it to the Lord to ſanctifie the work. Here then is an excellent agreement between the grace of God, and the endeavour of man. Further, after the feeling of the firſt grace man is not to lie idle; for, it is plainly expreſſed, <hi>after God hath given them repentance to come to the acknowledging of the truth,</hi> which is Gods act, then theſe words immediately are added, <hi>that they may recover themſelves out of the ſnare of the devil.</hi> The word in the Original is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that they may awake out of the ſnare of the devil. It is a metaphor drawn from mens
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:168516:24"/>awaking out of their drink: For as long as they are in their natural eſtate, and do oppoſe the truth, they do not know the peril of their condition; but when the Lord gives repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, then they begin to recover themſelves out of their former miſerable condition, and look for further ſupply of grace. And ſo here alſo is an excellent concord betwixt Gods grace, and the endeavour of man. But yet for further proof of this, let us conſider that text, <hi>I am perſwaded that he who hath begun a good work in you, will performe it to the day of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.6. Here the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a work that is ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and theologically good. Secondly, concerning the perſon that doth begin the work. Thirdly, the perſons who they are in whom this good work is begun. Fourthly, the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment and performance thereof, <hi>I am perſwaded that he who hath begun a good work in you, will performe it unto the day of Chriſt.</hi> Here ſome may ſay, if the Apoſtle had that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, that the work of grace would go on in the <hi>Philippians</hi> hearts, whether they did eat or drink, ſleep or play, why did he not bid them be ſecure, and refer all to God? He had no ſuch meaning, for when he ſaith, <hi>I am perſwaded that he who hath begun a good work in you, will performe the ſame,</hi> he doth ſpeak in relation to his own prayer, in the words immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly going before. <hi>Alwayes in every prayer of mine for you all, making requeſt with joy for your fellowſhip in the Goſpel from the firſt day until now.</hi> In relation to this prayer, and their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtriving and looking after further degrees of grace, he was confident that the Lord who had begun the work, would bring the ſame to perfection. Let us conſider the words in the following chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> Here the Apoſtle doth attribute the whole work of mans ſalvation, the will and the deed, to the powerful working of the Spirit of God. And that which is more, he doth aſcribe it to his good pleaſure to work when he will, how he will, and upon what termes he will. If any ſhall ſay, ſeeing God doth all, what is here left for man to do? doth not this utterly drown and extinguiſh endeavour? No: for upon this ground he exhorteth them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:168516:24"/>to work out their ſalvation with feare and trembling, ſeeing they have no natural ability and free-will of their own, but muſt meerly depend upon the grace of God for the ſupply of his Spirit to carry on the work; therefore they muſt walk humbly with him, and take the ſeaſon of grace as it is offered. Becauſe the husbandman cannot make the Sunne to ſhine, and the raine to fall at his own pleaſure, therefore he doth wait upon God for the ſeaſons. Even ſo becauſe in the work of mans ſalvation, the will and the deed doth meerly depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods good pleaſure, to work it when he will, and how he will, we are to apply our ſelves to him only. When he admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters the grace, we ſhould be careful to make uſe of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſeeing the matter is wholly in his hands we ſhould walk humbly with him. And thus Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> you ſee that though the action is mans, yet the ability to will and to do is only from God, and nothing from man. And ſo the natural abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which you endeavour to ſet up is nothing at all. Now let us ſee what you gather from the parable of the talents. <hi>I obſerve,</hi> ſay you, <hi>that Chriſt ſets no man on work whom he hath not enabled to perform it: for he giveth out his work anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to abilities,</hi> Matth. 25.25. <hi>Comparing himſelf to a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant he ſtraight way went from home, as if he had ſaid,</hi> I <hi>have ſo ordered my family, that I have ſeen my ſervants furniſhed: ſuch a courſe have I taken to give every one employment not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their abilities. And what could I have done more for them? do but name it. Is it not ſufficient that I have made men and women fit for my work? I gave them light to direct them, and they wanted for no materials, for time they had enough. They had my commands and perſuaſions, and alſo threats in caſe they did neglect,</hi> page 48. Theſe collections of yours from the parable of the Talents I might let paſſe, ſeeing I have ſome way hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at theſe things before. But becauſe the <hi>Pelagians, Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and you of the Separation do ſo triumph in the words of this Scripture, I will take the more pains to clear the meaning of the text. And I will do it the rather becauſe of one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar paſſage, which if it were clearly underſtood, would break the great deſign of all thoſe who endeavour to ſet up the will of man: They would quickly perceive that they have no ſuch
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:168516:25"/>colourable ground from the words of this Scripture. Firſt, I do willingly agree that the command doth ſtand in proportion to abilities, but how? not in proportion to natural abilities, not in proportion to abilities of grace in preſent poſſeſſion, but in proportion onely to the ſupply of the Spirit, as it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to adminiſter to them that ſhall work out their owne ſalvation, and by the prayer of faith wait upon the Lord for the performance of the promiſe. Now whereas the ſlothful ſervant did complaine againſt the Maſter for requiring more then he gave him ability to do, the Lord tells him plainly, though he had no ability of his own to husband the talent, yet <hi>he might have put the money to the exchanger.</hi> The force of which words is thus much, that though in theſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural works which men have to do in and toward the working out of their ſalvation they have no ability of their own, they may go to the exchangers, to the word of promiſe, to the prayer of faith, and to the continual ſupply of the Spirit of Chriſt. As the ability did lie in <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall: ſo now all ability is to be had from Chriſt onely. To him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that are weary and heavie laden muſt go for help. And the Apoſtle when he had exhorted the beleeving Epheſians to the performance of many duties, for matter of ability he ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up all with this concluſion, <hi>Now unto him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can aske or thinke according to the power that worketh in us,</hi> Epheſ. 3 20. Here it is plaine, that Chriſt giveth forth work anſwerable to abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but theſe abilities are not inherent in men, or in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power of mans own will, but they are wholly to be had from the ſupply of the Spirit of Chriſt. They who pray, ſeek, and aske they onely ſhall receive. We come now to your ſecond reaſon.</p>

                  <p>In this I am of your judgment, for if any ſhall ſay that the Lord doth all by the inward working of the Spirit, and doth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:168516:25"/>not leave ſo much to man as to be a free agent by the power of grace received, to what purpoſe are counſels commands and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect one given to him who is to perform the work. This may pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perly be applied to the <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> but it doth not any way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to us. For though we wholly aſcribe all to grace,<note place="margin">☜</note> yet we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge man to be a free agent, who worketh and acteth by the help of grace adminiſtred. Though God himſelf be almighty &amp; often doth work ſo almightily, that none can or ſhall reſiſt him, yet his way of working in the ſoul in the excitings and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of his grace are not always in that almighty way. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times men do reſiſt, nay the very elect themſelves do oppoſe the workings of his Spirit, though they do not, nor cannot finally reſiſt. We conſtantly affirme that the grace is Gods, and the act is mans. For proof of this let us conſider the meaning of that expreſſion, <hi>By the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace in me was not in vaine, but I laboured more then they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. Here he doth aſcribe all to grace, when he ſaith, <hi>by the grace of God I am what I am.</hi> Though he doth attribute all to grace as to the Architectonical and principal cauſe, for all was done by the vigour and efficacie of that grace which was in him, yet for all this he doth not deny himſelf to be a free agent. He did inſtrumentally work by the power of that grace which was in him. Therefore in the work of his Miniſtery there is a truth that grace did all, and <hi>Paul</hi> did labour more then any of the Apoſtles: Grace did it principally, and <hi>Paul</hi> did it organically and miniſterially. And thus you ſee though the action be mans, the vigour ſpirituality and efficacie is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God, and nothing from man. This is the ſubſtance of our doctrine. Now let us ſee how you concord Gods grace with mans endeavour. <hi>Without further controverſie,</hi> ſay you, <hi>let it be confeſſed that the teachings of God come in to the ſons and daughters of men as the tillings and manurings of God, to provoke them to produce obedient actions,</hi> page 50. This paſſage of yours we might let go for preſent, were it not for a <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſenſe which it carries with it. For from what Scripture or experience have you this ſimilitude, that mans nature is to be compared to a fruitful ſoile in ſuch things as concern ſalvation?
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:168516:26"/>A fruitful ſoile though it do want due culture, hath a natural aptneſſe to bring forth fruit: will you ſay that there is the ſame aptneſſe in the nature of man to produce actions of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? doth not this go againſt the ſcope of Scripture? and do not the Saints for the production of obedient actions finde need of a daily and continual ſupply of the Spirit of Chriſt? <hi>All ſhall turne to my ſalvation through your prayer and the ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.19. Though the Saints do bring forth fruit, and though it be the act of their own free obedience, yet it is not from nature as a fruitful ſoile, but from Chriſt the Vine, <hi>John</hi> 15.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our Saviour doth plainly ſhew that every branch abiding in him, brings forth fruit. But if you will needs argue from hence the goodneſſe and fertility of the branch in it ſelf, he ſaith in expreſſe termes, <hi>without me ye can do nothing.</hi> Further you add, <hi>If this opinion ſhould take place, that God giveth our actions, it would as well diſmiſſe the office of the Spirit of God, and ſo deſtroy the internal meanes. The Spirit ſtandeth at the doore of the heart, and calleth, provoking us with a multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of allurements, that we would put forth our abilities to a preſent performance of action,</hi> p. 51. Here, Sir, as I have formerly ſaid, we have nothing to do with that idle opinion, that obedient actions are only the gift of God, we have nothing to do with them who demoliſh the endeavour of man; let them bear their own burden whoſoever they be. But on the other ſide we muſt needs blame you for running into a contrary extreame, for whereas you ſay, <hi>that the Spirit ſtandeth at the doore of the heart, provoking us with a multiplicity of allurements to put forth our abilities to preſent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; here I would entreat you to define</hi> what thoſe abilities are which the Spirit doth provoke us to exert and put forth? If you mean our natural abilities (as you can mean no other, ſeeing they ſtand contradiſtinct to the allurements of the <hi>Spirit</hi>) then you will aſcribe the chief work of ſalvation to mans nature, and the part of the Spirit ſhall be onely to allure and perſwade. By this account not onely the action, but alſo the ability and the power to act will be from man.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old, the <hi>Arminians</hi> of late, and you now have ſuch frequent recourſe to this Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 19, 20. let us read the words. <hi>Becauſe thou ſayeſt I am rich, and increaſed in goods, and have need of nothing, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:168516:26"/>knoweſt not that thou art poor, miſerable, blind, and naked: I counſel thee that thou buy of me gold tryed in the fire that thou mayeſt be rich, and white rayment that thou mayest be clothed, that the ſhame of thy nakedneſſe do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eye-ſalve that thou mayeſt ſee. As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as I love I rebuke and chaſten, be zealous therefore and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. Behold I ſtand at the door and knock, if any man heare my voice, and open the door, I will come in and ſup with him.</hi> From the words theſe Corollaries may be deduced. Firſt, not onely the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> but alſo all men elſe are ſpiritually dead and miſerable, if we look upon them as conſidered in the ſtate of nature. Secondly, men by their natural ability do not diſcern the miſerie of that condition. Thirdly, ſuch as Chriſt doth intend to bring to ſalvation he will begin with them in the opening of the eye of their underſtanding to ſee that in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they are poor, miſerable, blind and naked. Fourthly, by the conviction of his Spirit he will ſhew them that he hath a ſupply for all their wants: for their blindneſſe he hath eye-ſalve, for their nakedneſſe he hath white raiment, for their poverty he hath gold tried in the fire, and for all their wants he hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable ſupply. Fifthly, the Lord Chriſt at ſundry intervals of time doth ſtand at the door &amp; ſhew theſe things to the hearts of the ſons men: if therefore they ſee them, receive them, and in the ſenſe of their own emptineſſe go to him for all, they ſhall have more large and full communications of himſelf, he will come in and ſup with them. This is the natural ſenſe of the text, and what is here to ſet up the ability of man: The whole ſcope of the place is rather to pluck down his abilities that the Lord Chriſt may be all in all. But in caſe you ſtand upon theſe words, <hi>if any man hear my voice, and open the doore,</hi> we grant that in the matter of ſalvation man is a free agent; when God ſends the Spirit into his heart to reprove him of ſinne; he is then able to judge himſelf, when the Lord alſo diſcovers the love of Chriſt to the heart, by the teachings of the Word without, and the Spirit within, he is then able to beleeve. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when God giveth a Chriſt-like diſpoſition, he is then able to ſhew ſon-like affections towards God, and make expreſſion that the Law is written in his heart: In a word, he hath power
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:168516:27"/>ſo farre to open the doore as he hath ability from Chriſt, he cannot go one ſtep further. And therefore when the Spirit ſtands at the doore and knocks, to ſpeak properly, <hi>there is no natural ability in us, all ability is from grace;</hi> we muſt look to Chriſt onely, and the more we look to him in the ſenſe of our own weakneſſe, the more we ſhall have. All that may truely be gathered from this Scripture is, that a man is a free agent in the work of his ſalvation, but the ability is onely from Chriſt and not from us. Now we will conſider the force of your third Reaſon.</p>

But you do not onely ſtrike at theſe, but againſt them alſo who are for the Lords free election, and the ſpecial communication of his own grace infallibly to bring his people to ſalvation. And thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſay you, ſuch an obedience may thus be compared, <hi>as if God ſhould come and put a purſe of gold into the hand of men and force it upon them, and call that their obedience; and to many other men give them not a penny-worth, and demand ſome of them, and becauſe it was not there diſpoſe of their perſons to everlasting ruine,</hi> page 53. Here you endeavour to miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the doctrine of the Lords free election, and make it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to your own ends. But we will make it clear that mans obedience may well conſiſt with the doctrine of election, and his diſobedience alſo may conſiſt with the doctrine of non-ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.<note place="margin">☞</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt, let us conſider the meaning of that place, I <hi>will make an everlaſting covenant with them, I will never turne away from them to do them good, I will put my feare into their hearts, and they ſhall never depart from me,</hi> Jer. 32.40.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:168516:27"/>That which is here ſpoken muſt needs be a promiſe to the elect, becauſe it is expreſſely ſaid, <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, I will never turne away from them.</hi> Theſe words do note the communication of an infallible grace, but yet not ſo as any kind of way to diminiſh and empaire the endeavour of man: for this is not wrought immediately by the Spirit alone, but mediately by the Spirit upon the heart of man. And therefore theſe words are immediately added, <hi>I will put my fear into their heart, and they ſhall never depart from me.</hi> Becauſe the Lord had an intent to keep them from back-ſliding, de did reſolve to infuſe a ſon-like fear into their hearts to avoid all ſpiritual dangers, and to keep themſelves from falling. And ſo we may ſee how the infallible adminiſtration of the grace may ſtand with the free act and endeavour of man. But let us go to another Scripture. <hi>I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and will give you a heart of fleſh, I will put my Spirit within you, and will cauſe you to walke in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgments and do them. Then ſhall ye remember your own evil wayes, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight for your iniquities, and for your abominations,</hi> Ezek. 36.25, 26, 27. Here in theſe words alſo there is a promiſe to the Lords peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar people, that he will beſtow his ſpecial grace upon them; in theſe words, <hi>a new heart will I give them, and they ſhall keep my commandments; I will waſh them with cleane water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, here is their particular act, by the power of grace received, they ſhall freely walk in the Lords ſtatutes when he ſhall give them a new heart; they ſhall loath their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions when he ſhall waſh them with cleane water. The more ſubtile ſort of <hi>Arminians</hi> in ſeveral Treatiſes do ſeeme to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe much to grace, onely they make the point of the queſtion to ſtand in the <hi>modus rei,</hi> or the manner of the grace, that God doth not ſo infallibly work upon the heart <hi>ut eventus non poſſit non ſequi,</hi> that the event cannot chuſe but follow. This is the ſtumbling ſtone and the rock of offence that they ſtumble at.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>let us conſider what is alledge in their Apology to the forementioned Scripture,</hi> Firſt, ſay they, <q>
                        <hi>this promiſe is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:168516:28"/>to the laſt times, therefore it cannot be applied to the converſion of the elect, which is one and the ſame in all times.</hi>
                     </q> Anſw. Though the promiſe is ſpecially to be applied to the call to the Jewes, yet it doth ſtrongly inforce the point. For the queſtion being onely <hi>de modo rei,</hi> concerning the manner of the thing this Scripture plainly ſheweth the certainty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of ſuch a grace, by and thorough which the Jewes ſhall be brought home in the laſt dayes. If we look to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſion of that Nation over all Countreyes of the world, we may conceive it a thing impoſſible to natural reaſon for them to be gathered together, yet God hath promiſed to gather them into one body, and that <hi>David</hi> ſhall be their King in the latter dayes. Even ſo, if we look to the enmity and perverſeneſſe of a people againſt the Goſpel of Chriſt, there is no Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole heaven for theſe many hundred years that hath been ſuch deſperate adverſaries as they have been. There are neither Engliſh, nor Spaniſh, nor French, nor Italian, no not Turks nor Tartars that are greater haters of the Goſpel then this people have been, and yet are: Yet notwithſtanding all this antipathy they ſhall be called, and thorough the call they ſhall be infallibly brought home in the latter times. Though according to natural reaſon this may ſeeme very improbable, God will certainly performe his promiſe, and no obſtacle or hindrance ſhall be able to obſtruct the work. From hence then it is clear, if we go to the <hi>modus rei,</hi> or the manner of the thing, we may eaſily collect that the way of God in working the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of his people may be after a certain and infallible manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, they argue, If God will do all by his power, <q>why are men commanded to make themſelves a new heart and a new ſpirit? This were irrational to do on mans part, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God hath already decreed and promiſed to do the work himſelf.</q>
                        <note place="margin">☞</note> Anſw.</hi> Though God doth reſolve certainly to bring a thing to paſſe in his decrees and purpoſes, though he doth promiſe alſo that it ſhall be certainly done, yet this doth not hinder the endeavour of man, ſeeing it is his manner to bring things about by mans endeavor as the chief mean or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As for example, when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and his company were
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:168516:28"/>in danger of ſhipwrack, the Lord did tell him by night in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>that there ſhould not be the loſſe of any mans life, but of the ſhip onely,</hi> Acts 27.22. Here was a certaine promiſe, and thereupon the Apoſtle did certainly conclude that they ſhould all come ſafe to land. You will ſay then, did not the certainty of the promiſe, eſpecially ſeeing God would performe it by power, hinder their endeavour? No: For when they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a place where two ſeas did meet, and the ſhip did ſtick faſt in the ſand, every man did ſhift for his own life, ſome by ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and ſome upon broken pieces of the ſhip, God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that there ſhould not be the loſſe of any mans life,<note place="margin">☜</note> and this he did effect by making every one of them careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his own life. So in the caſe of thoſe men which God doth intend to bring to eternal ſalvation, he will firſt or laſt, ſooner or later, and that by his own power make them careful of their own ſalvation. As in the words of the text, he firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give a new heart, that is, the ſpirit of love into the heart, and when this is done, then they ſhall keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. So then it is cleare that the infallibility of the decree of election, and the certainty of the promiſe of God do not make void the free obedience of that people which he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to bring to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>thirdly,</hi> they object, <q>
                        <hi>Though he doth give a new heart, it is not abſolutely neceſſary that he ſhould give it</hi> cum effectu, <hi>with the effect. He may give it with great efficacie, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe the grace may be reſisted by the malignity of the will of man.</hi>
                     </q> Anſw. It is confeſſed that God may give grace, and men may reſiſt, and by reſiſting may loſe the grace that is offered. But the queſtion is, whether the new heart or the new ſpirit may finally be reſiſted, ye or no? If any man beleeve that it may, let him anſwer the words of that promiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32. <hi>Behold the dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, not according to the Covenant which I made with their fathers when I tooke them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, which Covenant they brake. But this is the Covenant that I will make after thoſe dayes, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> In the preſent caſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:168516:29"/>then, the writing of the Law in the heart muſt be meant only of an effectual inſcription; if this be not ſo, where will be the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the old &amp; the new Covenant, betwixt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that God made with the people when he brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Covenant that he will make in the latter days? For the covenant that he made with them at their coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> they brake, but the new Covenant ſhall not be broken: when the Lord ſhal write his Law in their hearts, then all <hi>ſhall know him from the greatest to the leaſt.</hi> Therefore, if we go to the manner of the thing, the work of converſion may be wrought with efficacie and infallibility on Gods part, and yet there be no detriment or dammage to mans obedience.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Everard,</hi> I have ſtayed the longer upon this point, to to ſhew you the inequality of your ſimilitude, <hi>as though God did deale with his elect in forcing a purſe of gold upon them, and then call that their obedience.</hi> We ſay the contrary, God may infallibly work upon the hearts of his people, and by his neceſſary and infallible workings bring them on to a free and a chearful obedience. Their free endeavour muſt needs ſtand with a ſubordination under his decrees and workings.</p>
                  <p>Now let us go to the harder caſe of the Non-elect; and here the decree of God, and the certainty thereof doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way free men from being the children of diſobedience. Let us take a view of that Scripture, <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-ſuffering veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction?</hi> Rom. 9.22. From hence it is cleare that there are none deſtroyed but ſuch as are prepared and fitted for deſtruction; and for the preparation the Lord in the ordinary way doth endure men firſt with much long-ſuffering. For the clearing of this, let us conſider that paſſage of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20. <hi>By which ſpirit alſo he went and preached to thoſe ſpirits that are in priſon, which ſometimes were diſobedient when once the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering of God waited in the dayes of Noah.</hi> Therefore let the decree of non-election be what it will be in the purpoſe of God, yet we are ſure in the ordinary way it is not put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">☞</note> but the Lord doth endure men firſt with much long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We may proceed with this gradation, None are deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:168516:29"/>but thoſe that are made fit for deſtruction: None are made fit for deſtruction but ſuch as he hath endured with much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; and there is none that he hath endured with much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, but he hath ſtriven with them from time to time with convictions of his Spirit, and they have ſhewed many acts of diſobedience againſt ſuch inward motions and workings. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the decree of non-election, (as it is to be put in execution) may well ſtand and conſiſt with the diſobedience of man: ſo that he himſelf ſhall be the cauſe of his own condemnation. If this be ſo, I know no juſt cauſe you have to complaine; for ſay you, <hi>I wonder how they can call it our duty, while they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that God never intended that we ſhould do that work, and ſo never furniſhed us to that purpoſe,</hi> page. 55. If you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply theſe things to us and our doctrine, (as it is probable you do,) then I muſt tell you that you heap up calumnies; we do not maintaine any ſuch poſition, that the Lord doth not ſurniſh the non-elect with abilities; there is none of them all but he hath more ability then he uſeth. And for the temporary beleever, we hold that he hath very great qualifications, and is able to go very ſarre. Here onely lies the point of the difference, that the Lord doth not give him ſuch abilities as will infallibly carry him on unto ſalvation. This is his peculiar dealing with the elect, as may be proved from divers Scriptures.<note place="margin">☜</note> But here perhaps will lie a great queſtion between the grace adminiſtred to the elect, and to the non-elect, where doth the way part, and how ſhall we diſtinguiſh them? In this caſe we may not look ſo nicely to every punctilio, there is a day appointed in which God will judge the world, yet for the particular time no man can tell when it ſhall be, that all may be prepared for it. So in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, it is confeſſed by all ſerious and ſober-minded men, that God doth adminiſter his grace to bring the ſonnes of men to ſalvation, yet for the manner, why he ſhould adminiſter it to ſome this way, and to others that way; why he ſhould continue it to ſome notwithſtanding all reſiſtings, and on the contrary take it from others when they have reſiſted ſuch a certaine time. For theſe various &amp; ſeveral ways of adminiſtration, I think they are of ſet purpoſe kept ſecret in the will of God that men ſhould work out their ſalvation with fear and trembling, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:168516:30"/>they ſhould ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, that they ſhould not neglect the day of their viſitation. We now come to your fourth reaſon.</p>

                  <p>Let them conſider this to whom it doth belong, it is none of our doctrine: but you are as faulty in the other extreame, when you ſay that God requireth action of none but thoſe whom he hath furniſhed with preſent abilities. This (if my judgment be any thing) is the grand fallacie that hath not onely impoſed upon you, but alſo upon many others of your way. But ſeeing you will needs have it that God calleth men to act according to preſent abilities, I pray you tell me what preſent ability had <hi>Moſes</hi> to bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt?</hi> what ſhips had he prepared to tranſport them over the red ſea? ſhew me alſo what proviſion he had laid up in ſtore for fourty years march thorough the wilderneſſe? what councel of warre had he to judge when it was fit for the campt to move. Nay thorough the whole ſtory of the Bible make it appear what abilities any of the Saints had,<note place="margin">☞</note> if you ſpeak of their own abilities to do the greateſt works of faith. In theſe caſes I think rather that Gods Word of command is given in mutual relation and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie to his Word of promiſe, and not to abilities which any man hath in preſent poſſeſſion. If we attentively conſider the meaning of the Scriptures we ſhall finde when the Spies return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſearching the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the great ſinne of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was, that they meaſured all by preſent abilities. Becauſe the ſonnes of <hi>Anach</hi> were there, they did conclude it was a thing impoſſible to bring that Land into ſubjection, they never conſidered that it was the Land of promiſe, and that the Lord himſelf would do all by his own power, <hi>Num.</hi> 13.27, 28. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.1, 2, 3. And for that ſpeech of yours, <hi>that Chriſt never blamed the unprofitable ſervant for want of abilities;</hi> Though he did not blame him for that, yet he did condemne him for not putting his money to the exchanger. In
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:168516:30"/>this caſe though he had no ability of his own, yet he might have it from another, if he had looked after the grace and the power of God. And further, whereas you ſay <hi>that Chriſt calls for action of them onely whom he hath already furniſhed;</hi> this is not ſo, he calleth for action of thoſe whom he either hath furniſhed, or will furniſh. The Martyrs have been called forth to great ſufferings in times of perſecution, yet the whole ſtock of abilities was not put into their hands at one time: they did beleeve what God did call them to, he would make them able to bear. And that which they had not for the preſent, they did beleeve they ſhould have, ſeeing he was faithful that had promiſed. As for that inſtance which you aledge, that <hi>Jethro, Moſes his father in Law did blame him for doing of that which he was not able to do.</hi> Conſider the caſe aright, <hi>Jethro</hi> did queſtion whether the thing which <hi>Moſes</hi> did, was commanded of God or no, and therefore he did debate the matter with him, why he did undertake a buſineſſe beyond his ſtrength. But it is not ſo in the matter that concernes our ſalvation; we are to do that which is commanded of God, and to look to him for ſupply of Spirit for the performance of his own work. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this you let fall a deſperate ſpeech; <hi>Such a neglect of action</hi> (ſay you) <hi>will never deſerve to be called ſinne, becauſe it is a forced waiting and ſtaying the Lords leaſure. But where men are entituled offendors for not putting forth to action, is not becauſe they ſtayed for Gods acting, but rather God for a long time waited for them,</hi> pag. 57. I anſwer, men are entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led offendors both wayes; firſt, becauſe they come not in to God when he calls them. Secondly, when they do not waite upon him for the performance of the promiſe. The Iſraelites in the Wilderneſſe may be an example; they ſinned in this, in that they came not in to God when he waited for them; and it is as true alſo that they ſinned in not putting forth to action when they had ſo many promiſes of the preſence and aſſiſtance of God to go along with them. The Pſalmiſt did aſſigne this as the chief cauſe of their grand rebellio, <hi>they alwayes erred in their hearts, becauſe they knew not his wayes.</hi> They would have all in preſent poſſeſſion, and God would have them alſo to live by faith in the promiſe.</p>

                  <p>In this I do agree with you, that they do involve themſelves in many difficulties whoſoever they be that teach that obedient actions are ſo the gift of God, that man is meerly paſſive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life or motion. There are more then too many in theſe dayes that are of this belief, and there are a multitude of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furdities which follow that doctrine. But whereas you admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us of harbouring ſuch a tenent as in the very nature of it breedeth ſuch conceits that God is a reſpecter of perſons; this imputation, as of old, ſo now of late, in your apprehenſion doth ſeeme to lie heavie upon them that maintaine the doctrine of Gods free election. But in this caſe the Apoſtle himſelf doth make a plaine and an expreſſe anſwer, <hi>he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and he hath compaſſion on whom he will have compaſſion,</hi> Rom. 9.11, 12, 13. The ſenſe of the place is briefly this, If God chuſe <hi>Jacob,</hi> it is an act of his meere mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he is not bound to it by any rule of diſtributive juſtice: and if he hate <hi>Eſan,</hi> that is, if he do not love him with that pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar love infallibly to bring him to ſalvation, he hath no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon him, he may do with his own as he pleaſeth. His pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is in the ſalvation of the elect to magnifie the riches of his grace, as in the condemnation of the non-elect to ſet forth the glory of his juſtice. But let us more attentively conſider the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>What if God, willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-ſuffering veſſels of wrath fitted for deſtruction,</hi> Rom. 9.23. <hi>Camero</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the place hath this good obſervation: <hi>Which difference, ſaith he, the Apostle hath prudently noted, for when be doth diſcourſe concerning them whom God hath called, he doth uſe theſe words, whom he hath before prepared to glory, to wit, that he may here decipher the effectual work of God. But when he doth ſpeak of them whom he doth not call, he doth not ſay
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:168516:31"/>that they are ſuch veſſels which God hath before prepared, but ſimply veſſels prepared and fitted, according to that ſaying, thy deſtruction is of thy ſelfe O Iſrael.</hi> Upon theſe grounds we do conclude, in matter of election and non-election there can be no reſpect of perſons with God: for the elect are ſaved meerly by grace, and the non-elect are damned and caſt away juſtly for their ſins; nay, for the ſlighting, neglecting, and moſt wilfull abuſing of the patience and long-ſuffering of God, and the voluntary hardning themſelves in ſin.</p>

                  <p>This argument of yours, if it were rightly applied, would be of good moment againſt that kind of men who are for enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſmes. For if it be a good reaſon to affirme that there are no more worlds in being becauſe God hath made no more; the reaſon muſt be one and the ſame, according to their doctrine, ſuch and ſuch a man doth not repent becauſe God did not work repentance in him as an inanimate inſtrument. For our parts we plainly affirme, that though God doth work repentance in men, he doth it <hi>congruenter,</hi> as in rational and intellectual crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For we are to ſuppoſe that men have principles to act them, and therefore when the Lord doth enable them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, they have power to turne from their evil way. In this caſe as repentance is Gods gift, ſo it is mans act; man doth freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent by the power of grace received; Many alſo voluntarily do harden their own hearts in neglecting of that grace w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſhould bring them to repentance. From all which we do conclude, that obedient actions do belong to men as the power, ability and grace is wholly from God.</p>
                  <p>We will go on, &amp; conſider the Scriptures which you do pervert to a contrary ſenſe. To begin therefore with that place of the Apoſtle, <hi>work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling, for
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:168516:32"/>it is God that worketh in you the will and the deed.</hi> Here ſay you, If God <hi>doth work the will and the deed, what is here left for man to do?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such a good proficient you are in your way of wrangling againſt the Prieſts (as you call them) that now at laſt you are come to except againſt the words of the Apoſtle. Doth he not ſay in plaine and ſignificant terms, that the Lord doth work in us the will and the deed? and doth he not upon this ground exhort men to work out their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with fear and trembling? But that we may clear the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and connexion of the text, we will note three things in ſpecial. Firſt, we are to diſtinguiſh betwixt Gods dealing in the work of creation, and his dealing in the working of mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For his dealing in the work of creation, he made man in a moment of time; but for the work of ſalvation, he doth carry it on ſtep by ſtep. Againe, in the work of creation the Lord did make man without any act of his own, he did not know when he was in making: but it is otherwiſe in the act of ſalvation, this work is carried on by mens own acts, and by the concurrence of their own endeavour. And hereupon though the Apoſtle doth affirme that God doth work the will and the deed, yet it is mens duty alſo to work out their own ſalvation. Secondly, we are to note that the act of man in working out his own ſalvation muſt be by a ſupernatural power; he may govern families, he may build Cities, he may learn arts and ſciences without the communication of any ſpecial grace from God: but he cannot do ſo in the working out of his own ſalvation; God muſt firſt work the will and the deed, and then man will be able to work out his ſalvation, and not till then. Thirdly; theſe words are added, <hi>with fear and trembling,</hi> to ſhew that man muſt do it humbly, carefully, and with dependance upon the grace of God, ſeeing he hath not the power of inſpiration in his own hand. But more fully to ſet forth the meaning of the Apoſtle, we will cite another Scripture which is parallel to this. Theſe are the words of the Lord to the children of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> in the wilderneſſe, <hi>Behold I ſend mine Angel before thee to keep thee in the way to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Beware of him, provoke him not, for he will not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don your tranſgreſſions, for my name is in him. But if thou
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:168516:32"/>ſhalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I ſpeak, then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adverſary to thine adverſaries, for my Angel ſhall go before thee and bring thee unto the Amorites, the Hittites and the Perizites, and I will cut them off. Exod.</hi> 23.21, 22, 23. Here, if you diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the text, do ly firſt a promiſe, ſecondly a Precept. For the promiſe the Lord doth tell them, <hi>That he will ſend his Angel before them</hi> as a Convoy, to guide them in the way, and to plant them in the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And for the way, becauſe they were to be in the Wilderneſſe fourty years, without fields, without clothing, without means to ſuſtain the life of man, therefore they ſhould be more immediately under the cuſtody and tuition of the Angel. This Angel muſt needs be Chriſt, he was the pillar of cloud that went before them by day, and he was the pillar of fire that was their leader by night, he fed them with Manna, and ſupplied their want with water out of the rock. To this the Apoſtle ſeemeth to allude, <hi>they did all eat the ſame ſpiritual meat, and did all drink the ſame ſpiritual drink, for they drank of that rock which followed them, and that rock was Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.4, 5. Further, after the fourty years pilgrimage were ended the Lord doth promiſe that their Convoy ſhould not leave them, but that he ſhould go before them and drive out the Canaanites, becauſe it was not in their own power to bring the land into ſubjection. This is the Lords promiſe, and therefore in ſenſe and ſubſtance the Angel muſt do the whole work. Secondly, let us conſider what is the duty of the people, and that is contained in theſe words, <hi>Beware of him, obey his voice, provoke him not, &amp;c.</hi> Becauſe they did wholly depend upon him for all, therefore they ſhould be careful to obſerve him and to follow him in his leadings. The force of the reaſon is the ſame in the words of the text, <hi>work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling, becauſe God works in you the will and the deed;</hi> becauſe his Spirit is all in all the cauſe of mans ſalvation to carry on the work; becauſe his Spirit doth convince, reprove, teach, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſeal, and guide the Saints, therefore they ſhould walk tenderly and carefully toward him; The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>grieve not the Spirit of grace by which ye are ſealed unto the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> Epheſ. 4.30. In caſe they do with him as diſobedient
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:168516:33"/>children do with their parents, when they give them good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, the Spirit will neither comfort nor ſeal them any more, but will leave them to a ſtate of darkneſſe and diſcomfort. And this is the true meaning of the text. We may hereby underſtand how God doth carry on the whole work of ſalvation, and this doth no way impair or diminiſh the endeavour of man.</p>
                  <p>In the cloſe of all you tell us, <hi>Let us ſay with the Apoſtle, in our hearts, that we deſire to strive with dayly labourings, according to the mighty workings whereby he worketh in us,</hi> Col. 1.29. <hi>And do not ſay any more it is God that worketh our actions, but be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him that giveth us ſufficient means,</hi> Page 63. You have heard before that the Lord doth work in us the will and the deed, and therefore the ſpirituality of the action is wholly from God, though we are free workers by the help of his grace. But let us take your words in the faireſt conſtruction; If you will ſtand firmly to this principle, that God gives ſufficient means by a power working in us, you need not fly to the purity of nature, to natural free-will, and to ſuch like beggerly rudiments to ſalve the endevour of man. In this place you ſeem to ſpeak for grace, when elſewhere through your whole treatiſe you drive the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain altogether for the natural abilities of the will. But ſeeing you have offered this text to our conſideration, we will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to draw from it the concord betwixt the grace of God, and the endeavour of man. The words are theſe, <hi>Whereunto I alſo labour, ſtriving according to his working which worketh in me migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the work of the Miniſtery, <hi>whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that we may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I labour according to the mighty workings that he worketh in us.</hi> Here it is plain that the Apoſtle did work in teaching and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing every one, and it was not ſo much his work as the work of the Spirit in him and by him. When he was at <hi>Athens</hi> his Spirit was ſtirred up in him, when he ſaw the City wholly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Idolatry. Why are not the like excitations of ſpirit in men in there dayes who travell to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to <hi>Ligorn,</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeeing hoſe people are wholly given either to Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſuperſtition, or Popiſh Idolatry? The reaſon is manifeſt, the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:168516:33"/>ſame ſpirit doth not work ſo mightily in the hearts of men as it did ſometime in the heart of <hi>Paul;</hi> becauſe he was filled with the Spirit he did ſhew abundant ſympathy and bowells of affection towards all the loſt ſonnes of men. But to come to inſtances in theſe laſt times, when the Goſpel was plucked down, and the Maſs was ſet up in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, the Martyr being in a journey, declared his intention, that he would preach in his charg the next Lords day; and when he that journeyed with him, told him, then he would certainly be caſt into priſon; his anſwer was, <hi>I am in priſon, till I am in priſon.</hi> He was bound in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to preach the Goſpel to the ſoules which he had taken charg of; he could have no peace otherwiſe then in the diſcharge of his duty. He did labour freely, yet ſo as his labour was by the inward moving of the Spirit. But of all other places that paſſage of our Saviour is moſt uſed by the Enthuſiaſts, <hi>Ye ſhall be brought before Kings and Princes for my ſake, but when they ſhall deliver you up, take no thought how or what you ſhall ſpeak, for it ſhall be given to you in that houre what you ſhall ſpeak. For it is not ye that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father that ſpeaketh in you,</hi> Mat. 10.18, 19, 20. Though this promiſe is made to the Martyrs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors in times of perſecution, yet it is not made to them in that manner as to extinguiſh and drown all endeavour of their own; as though God would do all, and they ſhould be diſcharged of their duty. The promiſe is only made to ſuch as ſhould engage themſelves for Chriſt, and ſhould humbly in the uſe of the means depend upon him for the ſupply of his Spirit. And thus we ſee that the Spirit does all, and yet in the moſt ſpiritual actions man himſelf is a free-worker. <hi>It ſhall be given you in that houre what you ſhall ſpeak.</hi> This expreſſion, <hi>what you ſhall ſpeak,</hi> ſheweth plainly that the Saints are free Agents.</p>
                  <p>Let us now conſider that place, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>For by grace ye are ſaved through faith, not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">☜</note> Here you yield that <hi>ſalvation as purchaſed by Chriſt, is the gift of God, but you will not have faith it ſelf to be the gift of God:</hi> you grant one part of the text to deny another. If you conſider the words, you ſhall finde that not onely ſalvation, but alſo faith it ſelf is Gods free gift. If this be not ſo, how could the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians come to beleeve? The Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>they were dead in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:168516:34"/>treſpaſſes and ſinnes, they walked according to the courſe of the world, they fulfilled the lusts of the fleſh and of the mind.</hi> Therefore they could not come to beleeve by any natural ability, but meerly by the quickning work of the Spirit. Further, this expreſſion is added <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>We are his work manſhip created of God unto good works.</hi> By nature they were dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, and if that now they could perform any ſpiritual act they were made able to do this by the new creation or workmanſhip of God. Further, if faith be not the Lords gift, the believing Epheſians muſt be ſuppoſed to have it from their own ability. If this be ſo, how ſhall we agree with the ſcope of the Apoſtle? who ſaith in expreſſe termes, <hi>You are ſaved by grace through faith, not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God, not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> Truly Sir, if your faith be not Gods gift, it will be of your ſelf, and you will have cauſe of boaſting, as though you did make your ſelf to differ from other men, and what is this elſe but to go point blanck againſt the ſcope of the Scripture? And though I do plead this truth againſt you, in affirming faith to be the gift of God, yet I ſay alſo it is the act of man. God gives the grace, and man beleeves. Theſe two are not ſo parted aſunder, but that they may be joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>For your third Scripture, concerning the <hi>ſtriving for the faith given to the Saints</hi> which S. <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks of, this is not meant of the grace or habit of faith in the heart, but of the doctrine of faith onely: That men ſhould ſtrive to preſerve the Goſpel in its purity and integrity againſt the hereſies of the times. But you go further to ſhew the abſurdities that will follow upon the holding of that poſition, that obedient actions are the gift of God you ſay, <hi>If God ſhould give the actions as ſure as he giveth means to act, then a mans conſcience might and would as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him for want of means to act, as for want of action. But I never heard (ſay you) that any mans conſcience accuſed him for want of means to performe his actions, but becauſe be made not uſe of the means.</hi> In this paſſage of yours as ther eare ſome things which I allow as true and ſound: ſo there are others which I do reject as falſe and unſound, For, as I have ſaid before, they who deny a man to be a free Agent, I cannot ſee by the tenor
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:168516:34"/>of their doctrine how their conſcience can accuſe them for non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance of action; ſeeing they hold that both the act &amp; the means to act are onely from God, and man is meerly paſſive. So far you &amp; I are agreed, but whereas you oppoſe the carrying on of the work of ſalvation by the power &amp; the grace of God, in this you contradict the Scriptures, and by name that place of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>We are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. That the Saints do perſevere, it is mainly from the power of God who carries on the work: But how? not without their own endeavour. <hi>Ye are kept by the power of God through faith.</hi> Men muſt apply the promiſe of God, and that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his power to carry them on to ſalvation. And yet further, God ſpeaketh of his elect, <hi>I will put my Spirit in them, that they ſhall keep my Commandments and do them.</hi> But moſt plainly in that place, 2 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>We are bound to give God thanks for you brethren, that he hath choſen you from the beginning to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thorough the ſanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.</hi> In the Words going before, he doth ſpeak of the great Apoſtacy that ſhould be in all Anti-Chriſtian times; that becauſe men <hi>did not receive the truth in the love of it that they might he ſaved,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſhould deliver them over to ſtrong deluſions to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve lies. By way of oppoſition to theſe Apoſtates, the Apoſtle comforts the beleeving Theſſalonians with the infallibility and certainty of their ſalvation. But how would he bring them to ſalvation? <hi>thorough the ſanctification of the Spirit, and the belief of the truth.</hi> Theſe two means he doth name, to ſhew that God will bring none to ſalvation as the end, but he will firſt juſtify and ſanctifie them in the uſe of the means. Though he will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the work by his own power infallibly and certainly in the hearts of his people, yet their act endeavour and obedience ſhall go along with the working of his grace. Many ſuch like places might be brought to ſhew that the infallible workings of God may ſtand with the endeavours of his own people. Secondly, whereas you affirme <hi>That you never heard any mans conſcience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him for want of means, but for want of uſing the means:</hi> Oh Sir, in what corner of the world were you brought up, that the fame of this never came to your eares! I think it is a truth well known in the Church of God, that mens conſciences do accuſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:168516:35"/>them not onely becauſe they made no uſe of the means, but alſo becauſe thorough their own default the means are not adminiſtred to them, or that they are taken from them. If it had been your lot to viſit men in trouble of conſcience, in agonies and gripes upon their ſick-beds, there you ſhould have heard ſuch words as theſe, again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain repeated, <hi>Had I ſought God, had I prayed in faith of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, had I walked humbly with him, had I fruitfully uſed the grace administred to me as a good and profitable Steward, I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wanted the means to ſubdue the power and rage of ſuch and ſuch corruptions.</hi> It is meerely from mine own defect that there is ſuch a ſtrangeneſſe betwixt the Lord and me. Theſe are the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary complaints of men who neglect the day of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and you tell us you never heard any mans conſcience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him for the want of the means: when the talent was taken from the unprofitable ſervant he was deprived of the means: but was not that deprivation through his own fault? but you further add, <hi>If conſcience be ſo well informed, that it muſt and wil bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then of whom ſhal it bear witneſſe? againſt God? No marvail that there be ſo many corrupt ſayings, if God had given me abilities, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and actions, then I would have done it. Nay do not many ſay, I muſt be contented to ſtay Gods time? Hath God commanded you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time? Nay do not you diſcharge your ſelf of duties in ſaying it is not his time?</hi> page 72. Such a dextrous faculty you have in cavilling againſt the main truths of Chriſtianity. But when I read this and ſuch like paſſages thorough your whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I cannot but compare the ſtate of the Church in theſe times to the ſhip that carried Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> the forepart of it ſtuck in the ſand, and the hinder part of it was broken with the waves. Into ſuch deſperate extreams are we now fallen. For if we ſpeak of actions of obedience, if the power be not placed chiefly in the will of man, you and the whole nation of the Free-willers do tell us that we be diſcharged from duty, ſeeing we are caſt upon a neceſſity of waiting when the matter is not in our own hand. On the other ſide there is ſprung up a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fanatical men which are ſo oppoſite to the freedome of will, that they think the Spirit muſt do all: they will not give thanks at meat, nor pray in their families, nor hear the Word, nor perform any other ſpiritual duty, untill they have a motion
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:168516:35"/>of the Spirit. Indeed the Waiters in this ſenſe do come to your pitch, they think themſelves to be diſcharged from duty till the coming of the Spirit. But is there no middle between theſe deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate extreames? Is there no diſcharge of duty in obedience to the Commands of God? There is no man that lives in the Kingdome of grace, but in ſome one thing or other he muſt be contented to ſtay the Lords time: what then, ſhall we ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is neceſſitated to wait, he is therefore diſcharged of all duty? Not ſo: he is ſtill to act in a lower ſpheare, and to wait for further communications as it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to impart them. <hi>Theſe are the words of the Apoſtle, let us therefore as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as be perfect, be thus minded; and if in any thing you be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you. Nevertheleſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we have already attained, let us walk by the ſame rule,</hi> Phil. 3.15, 16. The meaning of the place is this; every man ſhould walk according to his preſent attainments and abilities,<note place="margin">☜</note> and in walking, doing and diſcharging his duty wait upon God for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcoveries. A natural man is furtheſt off from God: what then? is he abſolutely diſcharged from duty? Is he not to come to Church, to hear the Goſpel, and to wait upon the means? peradventure God may give him repentance to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of the evil of his ways. Though it is not in his own power to repent, yet thereby he is not acquitted and diſcharged from all performance of duty. And ſo in ſundry caſes, men are to diſcharge their duty according to preſent abilities, they are to walk in thoſe paths that he hath appointed, and to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for the ſupply of ſpirit. It is the voice of the Church in her great tribulation, <hi>I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my ſalvation,</hi> Mic 7.7. Now tell me I pray you, ſeeing the Church was compelled to ſtay Gods time, to wait as it were on a Watch Tower (for ſo the word in the Original doth ſignifie) will you lay that in this whole interval ſhe is diſcharged from all duty? This is not ſo; ſhe did diſcharge her duty in praying, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and looking to God onely, and in the performance of all theſe ſhe waited upon him for comfort; ſhe had none elſe in all the world, no father, no brother, no friend, no wiſedome of the fleſh, no other refuge but God onely. When ſhe had darkneſſe and no light, ſhe had a firme perſwaſion that at laſt <hi>he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:168516:36"/>would plead her cauſe, execute judgment for her, that he would bring her forth to light, and ſhe ſhould ſee his righteouſneſſe.</hi> But you go on, <hi>do not other men ſay of God, that he ſo pitied the world, ſeeing their hard cold frozen hearts, therefore of his own goodneſſe did he provide fewel enough to warm and melt them, but when that is done, with-holds the right hand of his power from putting the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el into a flaming fire to ſuccour them in their diſtreſſe, and then comes to them, and ſaith be warmed and comforted? likening God to that hard hearted man ſpoken of</hi> Jam. 2.15, 16. And more ſuch like paſſages you have page 72. Who theſe other men are whom you here intend I cannot certainly tell; if you mean the friends and followers of this Church from whom you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, I muſt tell you, you do charge us with that which we do not maintain; It is not the reſult of our doctrine, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble God to that hard hearted man, <hi>Who bids them be warmed, and gives them not wherewithall?</hi> We ſay there are promiſes to give faith, as well as to faith given; to give love, as well as to love given; to put fear into the heart, as well as to fear which is put into the heart. There are ſundry promiſes given to that end, that men may go chearfully about the performance of action, that doing their duties they may feel the power and preſence of the Spirit to go along with them. Therefore we do not ſay that God keeps the fewel in his own hand, and that men are frozen for want of heat. Theſe are your calumnies, but not our doctrine. But to aggravate the matter, you further adde, <hi>The Phyſician openeth the mouth of one in a hundred, and poureth it in by force, as for all the reſt they are not alotted any ſhare or part therein, and yet ſhall ſuffer deeply for not taking it, it being prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, but not given them.</hi> page 73. How hard a thing is it for you to leave your old cuſtome of corrupting our ſayings before you do confute them? We hold that there is a peculiar number which God hath choſen from the beginning to ſalvation; theſe in time he effectually calleth, juſtifieth and ſanctifieth; but we never teach that he poureth his grace into them by force. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for others, we hold there is a grace given to them: nay, temporary believers have very great degrees of grace which they fall from by their own deſault. It is an Impudent calumny then to affirme of us that we ſhould ſay there is no ſhare or part
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:168516:36"/>alotted to them; that grace is proffered, and not given. For my part I do believe in the ordinary way God gives more abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to men by the convictions of his Spirit then they do profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably uſe. All the difficulty of the point will come to this iſſue, touching the peculiarity of this grace which carries ſome infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly and certainly to ſalvation, when others are left for their reſiſting of the Spirit. If then you liſt to go further, and ask after the reaſon why God doth deal ſo unequally with men; here the Scriptures doe confine you to the Lords good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. This I am ſure they would not do if a ſubſtantial reaſon otherwiſe might be given from any thing in man himſelf. Why elſe ſhould our Saviour ſay, <hi>Thou hast hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent and haſt revealed them unto babes; even ſo, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe it pleaſeth thee.</hi> And yet further,<note place="margin">☜</note> they who do with judgment maintain the doctrine of election, do not think that this myſtery is to be propounded to all men, and at all times, as ſome unadviſed and inconſiderate men have done. To let paſſe all that may be ſaid, if you will go to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the ſeventeeth Article, you ſhall finde that the main ſenſe and import of the Article is this, that ſuch perſons onely ſhould have the conſideration of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection in Chriſt propounded to them, who feel in themſelves the Spirit mortifying the works of the fleſh. As for curious and carnal perſons it is more proper for them to look to the threats of God that they may be humbled; and for others alſo when they come to be humbled, it is not for them preſently and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to meddle with election, but with Gods promiſes in ſuch wiſe only as they are generally ſet forth to them in holy Scriptures, and that will of God they are to follow which he hath expreſſely declared and revealed in his own Word. This is the ſubſtance of the Doctrine of our Church concerning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and how by ſeveral ſtages and degrees we are to come to the aſſurance thereof.</p>
                  <p>We will adde a few words more to the clearing of the point, that we may ſee how the endeavour of man doth runne paralel with the grace of God and doth work under the grace. To this end let us diſtinguiſh the two ſtates of man; his ſtate before converſion, and his ſtate after. For the ſtate of man before
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:168516:37"/>converſion,<note place="margin">☞</note> though of himſelf he cannot think a good thought, yet by and thorough the convictions of the Spilt he may be helped to judge himſelf and to ſee the miſery of his loſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Many ſolid and judicious Writers do acknowledge ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneous works before converſion. Secondly, after conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when a man is brought ſo farre as to apprehend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and hath a real work wrought upon his heart in feeling the love of Chriſt to the loſt ſonnes of men: when he is come ſo farre the work is not at an end, for theſe two reaſons. Firſt, there are higher degrees of grace which a Chriſtian is to follow after: for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>not as though I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after to apprehend that for which alſo I am apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus. Brethren, I count not my ſelf to have apprehended but this one thing I do, forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are before, I preſſe towards the mark, for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 3.13, 14 Here theſe particulars are obſervable. Firſt, what was the goal that the Apoſtle did drive at, it <hi>was for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Secondly, with what affection did he follow after the mark of the price; he did forget the things that were behind, and did preſſe forward to the things that were before. As poor people in a dear year do preſſe forward, and reach over one anothers heads to receive a dole of meat or money. Thirdly, what was that which moved him to be ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his purſuit, it was not from any natural inſtinct, but from the drawing of the Spirit of Chriſt, which did whet on his deſires. I follow on to apprehend that for which I am ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended of Chriſt. Here is an excellent agreement betwixt the grace and the Spirit of Chriſt that did firſt apprehend <hi>Paul,</hi> and his endeavour that did follow on to apprehend. And thus we ſee from the beginning to the end, that the grace doth all, and the endeavour of man is never idle. I have been the more full in this Doctrine, becauſe the Enthuſiaſts on the one ſide, and the Arminians on the other ſide lie in camp againſt the Church. On either ſide they have ſome colour of truth to uſher in their damnable Poſitions, by and thorough which the ſimple are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared. And as many ſubtill Merchants, when they have bad
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:168516:37"/>corn to fell, put the beſt upon the top of the bag: even ſo do theſe ſeducers begin with very taking conſiderations, that by ſome preceding truths they may bring in their ſubſequent er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. The <hi>Enthuſiast</hi> will ſpeak againſt a notional faith, and againſt idle ſpeculations of Chriſt without power; and ſtand ſtrongly upon it that there muſt be a real and an inward work wrought upon the heart, or elſe all is nothing: and ſo farre he goes fair. But this is not enough with him, he is not contented onely to condemne them that make an Idol of the means, but alſo he will ſleight all means whatſoever; all reading of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, all frequenting of Ordinances, all ſtriving in prayer, all endeavour whatſoever with him are empty figures and bare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals. Now you on the other ſide turn unto another extream, and in your way you have alſo the beſt corn upon the top of the bag. You ſtand ſtrictly to maintain that a man is a free-worker in the matter of his ſalvation, otherwiſe exhortations and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions would be of no moment; and ſo farre you go very right. But this will not ſatisfie you unleſſe you may ſet up the natural ability of man, maintain free-will, and other ſuch like Pelagian poſitions. For theſe reaſons I have taken the more pains rightly to define and to ſtate the truth betwixt the grace of God and the endeavour of man, to avoid the deteſtable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors on both extreames. Now I will proceed to your next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Containing divers queſtions with their ſolutions.</head>
               <p>HERE in the beginning you raiſe two queſtions concerning the ability which <hi>Adam</hi> had before the fall; and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound a third, whether the fall was decreed by the ſecret will of God? For the ability which <hi>Adam</hi> had before his fall, I do willingly acknowledge that men may raiſe intricate and thorny queſtions about this, though to ſmall purpoſe. But touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this point I do deſire to lay down ſome neceſſarie obſervations, becauſe I will not ſtand upon every punctilio;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:168516:38"/>And then I will come to the ſolution of your chief queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the true cauſe of the fall, we do affirme that our firſt parents being ſeduced by the temptation of Sathan, did vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily and freely eate the forbidden fruit. Their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective will was the immediate cauſe of their fall. Secondly, God was pleaſed according to his wiſe and juſt Councel to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the fall, that thereby a doore might be opened to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Chriſt for the more full declaration of the glory of his grace in the ſalvation of man as fallen. Thirdly, for the power that <hi>Adam</hi> bad to ſtand or fall, as on the one ſide we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſay that he was made in a ſtate very good and free from all ſinne: ſo alſo it muſt needs be affirmed, that he was made in a mutable ſtate, farre different from the ſtate of the bleſſed Saints and Angels confirmed in grace, and fartheſt off from the immutability of the Creator himſelf. Fourthly, if the queſtion be put, how farre did the Lord go in the fall of <hi>Adam?</hi> we muſt needs affirme that he created the firſt man in ſuch a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate that he might freely obey all his commands: only he did not ſuſtain him with that ſpecial and infallible grace to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him from falling. Theſe foure obſervations, if they be rightly underſtood, will help to expedite and clear many hard queſtions that may be propounded concerning the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall. We come now to your chief queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Had not God appointed that</hi> Adam <hi>ſhould fall by his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret will, before by his revealed will he commanded him to ſtand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you endeavour in the beginning to ſhew <hi>that the reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will of God before it was first communicated, was his ſecret will; and being once revealed, it loſeth the title of a ſecret will to them to whom it is revealed.</hi> page 77. In this paſſage of yours there are ſome words of truth, though, after your manner, you make an ill uſe of them. I yield in the general, that the revealed will of God was ſometimes his ſecret will before it was revealed. But the queſtion in hand is this, when <hi>Adam</hi> knew his duty that he ſhould not eat of the forbidden fruit, was not that part of the will of God concerning the permiſſion of the fall, and ſending
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:168516:38"/>of the Son, part of the ſecret will of God? and whether by right ought it not to be ſecret ſo long as he was upon the triall or his obedience? for the clearing of the point we will ſpeak ſomewhat more largely concerning the ſecret will of God. There is one part of his ſecret will abſolutely ſecret, that never ſhall be known either in this life or in that which is to come. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the caſting away of the Jewes, and their wonderful calling again, concludeth, <hi>O the depth of the riches, of the wiſdome, and the knowledge of God!</hi> Rom. 11.33. There is then a part of the ſecret will of God, eſpecially in the reaſons of his decrees, which none either can or ſhall know. Secondly, there is a part of his ſecret will which though it ſhall be revealed in the world to come, yet it muſt be concealed in this life. <hi>Now are we the ſonnes of God, but it is not yet manifeſt what we ſhall be,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.1, 2. Though the Saints know much of the mind of Chriſt, and feel his love in their hearts by the teaching and demonſtration of the Spirit, yet the excellency of their future glory is hidden from them. Thirdly, there is a part of the ſecret will of God which though it be hidden from ſome, yet it is revealed to others, even in this life. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did ſee thoſe things which the Prophets and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men could never ſee. The Lord ſhewed <hi>Peter</hi> by what death he ſhould glorifie God, but he did not ſhew this to other men, no not to <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſciple, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.20, 21. Fourthly, to one and the ſame man that part of the will of God which was ſecret heretofore by the event or revelation may prove to be his revealed will; and ſo in the particular caſe of <hi>Adam,</hi> the permiſſion of the fall and the promiſe of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Son were the concealed will of God for a ſeaſon, and were afterward made known by the event. If this be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we have as much as we do deſire. But you put the queſtion, <hi>How God could decree by his ſecret will that</hi> Adam <hi>ſhould fall before in his revealed will he commanded him to ſtand?</hi> As hard a caſe as you make it, I believe there is no man but will eaſily underſtand, that that which the Lord had decreed concerning the fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in his ſecret will from all eternity, muſt needs go before his temporal commands and injunctions. But that which offends you is the ſeeming contrariety of the two wills. You ſay,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:168516:39"/>
                  <hi>is it a ſmall thing that the righteouſneſſe of God ſhould be queſtioned upon ſuch low termes, as to imagine that when, in his revealed will he ſhall ſay, eat not, in his ſecret will he ſhall ſay, thou ſhalt eat? This opinion that renders God to have two wills, renders them divided in their nature when they are but differing in termes. For the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal will is not another will, but the ſame made manifeſt.</hi> page 79. That the will of God is one entire will in ſubſtance, we do affirm as well as you, yet we would have you to obſerve that one and the ſame will may be diſcriminated and diſtinguiſhed by divers relations. As one and the ſame fire that hardens the clay may ſoften the wax: ſo one and the ſame will may be diſtinguiſhed according to divers operations. Let us note the diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Gods will of decree and his will of command. That ſuch a diſtinction muſt be made between theſe two wills is clear and manifeſt from many Scriptures: <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid to his brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.7, 8. <hi>Ye ſent me not hither, but God.</hi> His ſending into <hi>Egypt</hi> was by Gods will of Decree, to ſave much people alive; yet none can ſay that <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren did the Lords will of command; they went againſt his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, when they ſold their brother as a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave. So it is expreſſely ſaid of the ſons of <hi>Eli, that they would not hearken unto the voice of their father, becauſe the Lord would ſlay them,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.25. Theſe diſobedient children in not hearkning to the voice of their Father did fulfill the Lords will of Decree, who had a purpoſe to judge the houſe of <hi>Eli</hi> for their ſinnes. But we cannot ſay that they did obey the Lords will of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, unleſſe ſuch a command may be produced that children ought not to obey their parents. So in the caſe of crucifying the Lord Chriſt, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>they did whatſoever thy hand and thy counſel determined before to be done. Herod, Pilate,</hi> and the Nation of the Jewes did perform the Lords will of Decree to crucifie Chriſt, yet we cannot ſay they did perform his will of command. Theſe and many other examples may be brought to prove the neceſſity of ſuch a diſtinction. And though the Arminians (<hi>Corvinus</hi> by name) do cavil at words and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, yet they cannot rationally deny the ſubſtance of the thing. And therefore to the point in hand we ſay, it is true in a ſenſe that God did not will the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> that is, he did not approve that ſinne by his will of command; yet in a ſenſe it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:168516:39"/>is as true, that by his will of decree he did permit it. As in the like caſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>There muſt be hereſies amongſt you, that they which are approved may be made manifeſt.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.19. if there muſt be hereſies, this is ſpoken in relation to the will of God, not in relation to his will of command, for then God would have given men a command to raiſe hereſies and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable doctrines in his Church, which none will imagine. But <hi>there must be hereſies,</hi> this is in relation to his will of Decree, to tolerate ſuch things for the clearer tryal of thoſe that are ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere. So in the preſent caſe, God did will the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> not by his will of command, for he gave him no command to eat of the forbidden fruit, but by his will of Decree he was pleaſed to permit the fall that it might be ſubſervient and conducing to his more excellent end of ſending the Son for the full declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the glory of his grace; which otherwiſe would not have been ſo conſpicuous if the firſt man had not fallen. So then, to gather up all into one ſum, you may eaſily underſtand, if you will, how God in his will of command may ſay eat not, and yet in his ſecreet will permit him to eat. Theſe two are not ſo put aſunder, but they may well be joyned together. But ſtill you take offence at the contrariety of the two wills. You ſay <hi>There is an impoſſibility for</hi> Adam <hi>to ſerve two Maſters, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when one commands him to stand by a revealed will, and the other hath determined the fall by his ſecret will at the ſame time: unleſſe he could ſerve the one in the forenoon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the afternoon.</hi> And yet further, to amplifie the difficulty, you ſay, <hi>The ſecret will is the controuler, for let the revealed will command any thing, we are to center in the determination of the ſecret.</hi> And then you pathetically call upon man <hi>to bewail the time that ever be had a being in this world, becauſe he is ſure to come to ruine which will ſoever he obeys. If</hi> Adam <hi>did obey the ſecret will of God, then the penalties inflicted by the revealed will would fall upon him.</hi> And then you conclude in theſe words, <hi>Might we not ſay farewell all hopes of another life, and ſo hang down our heads, crying out, alaſſe we are undone! our Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are not agreed? for what the one ſayes do, the other determines that he ſhall not do.</hi> And much more you have to the ſame effect, page 80. But all may be anſwered in a few words. We plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:168516:40"/>affirme, in matters of obedience men have nothing to do with the ſecret will of God, according to that determination, <hi>Secret things belong to God, but thoſe things which are revealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to us, and to our children for ever, that we may do the words of this Law.</hi> Deut. 29.29. This alſo is the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England, That men ſhould not meddle with predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and election, but thoſe only who have the fruits of election, who are called, juſtified and ſanctified. For the ordinary ſort of men, they only are to look at the general threats that they may be humbled, and to the general promiſes, that you may beleeve, Artic</hi> 17. And ſo in the particular caſe of <hi>Adam,</hi> we ſay that he had nothing to do with the ſecret will of God concerning the permiſſion of the fall, his duty only was to look to the command. That was the Cynoſure or only rule which he was to be guided by. And it is the duty of us all to do that which the Lord commandeth, and to reſt upon him to make our Leaders to agree. It doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to you, nor me, nor any man living to make a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation betwixt theſe two wills in their ſeeming differences, let us keep the ordinary path. But if you will ſay, <hi>that the ſecret will is that which doth prevail;</hi> though this doth prove true in the event, yet nevertheleſſe the revealed will of God is the onely rule or cannon which we muſt walk by; as for example, the Lord in his revealed will required <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his ſon <hi>Iſaac</hi> in ſacrifice, when in his ſecret will he had decreed that <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi> ſhould not be ſacrificed. If we go to the event, the ſecret will was the more preponderating and prevailing will of the twain. Though it was, yet the obedience of <hi>Abraham</hi> had its ſpecial teſtimony in this, that he had regard to the revealed will of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.2, 12. So in the caſe of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was ſent with a meſſage to him, <hi>ſet thy houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye and not live,</hi> Iſa. 38.2. and yet we finde that the Lord in his ſecret will had decreed that he ſhould not dy at that time: fifteen years more were added to the dayes of his life. In the preſent caſe then, though the ſecret will did carry the ſway, yet the commendation of the obedience of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did ly in giving aſſent to the threatning of God denounced by the mouth of the Prophet. Though the denunciation was meerely conditional, ſpoken onely in relation to ſecond cauſes,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:168516:40"/>
                  <hi>thou ſhalt dye of the preſent diſeaſe, unleſſe thou humble thy ſelf, and by fervent prayer ſeek the face of God.</hi> Though this declaration of the will of God did imply a condition, yet becauſe it was the will declared and outwardly revealed to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> he was to have reſpect to this onely. He was not (whatſoever you ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to the contrary) at a dilemma or ſtrait, which of theſe two wills ought to be obeyed, he never lamented the day of his birth becauſe his Leaders were not agreed. He never faulted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of the two wills, that the revealed will ſhould ſay thou ſhalt dy, and the ſecret will imply thou ſhalt live. What God had revealed concerning his preſent death he did beleeve the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence outwardly made known to him; as for Gods ſecret De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, he had nothing to do with that, which did meerely lie hid in God. We read indeed after his humiliation when the Lord had made known ſo much of his ſecret purpoſe that he would adde fifteen yeares more to the dayes of his life, then he was bound to believe and to live in faith of that particular promiſe which was made. I might go further with the example of the Ninevites, the Lords revealed will or his ſentence outwardly denounced, was, <hi>Yet fourty dayes and Nineve ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> Jonah 3.4. Now in his ſecret will or abſolute Decree the Lord had not purpoſed that <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed, but that that people ſhould eſcape by true repentance at that time. Though the ſecret will did prevaile, or to uſe your language, was the will <hi>that did controll,</hi> yet for the time being the Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites had nothing to do with the will of Decree, no further then this, <hi>Who can tell whether the Lord will return from his fierce an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?</hi> verſe 9. The will which they were immediately to believe, was the ſentence denounced by the mouth of the Prophet; they were bound to believe that their ſinnes were ſo great that they did deſerve deſtruction, and that the Lord would certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them within the ſpace of fourty dayes unleſſe they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in that limited time. Their beleeving the revealed will of God, and their trembling at his Word was one principal mean to bring about his ſecret will, and what he had decreed in his ſecret will concerning their preſervation. And though the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation by the Miniſtery of <hi>Jonah</hi> came not to paſſe, it was no falſe meſſage, becauſe it was reverſible upon a tacite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:168516:41"/>which the Lord was pleaſed for a ſeaſon to conceal from the Ninevites, to drive them more effectually out of their carnal ſecurity. I might adde more examples to prove the vanity of your exceptions; but I will go neerer the matter, and that in a harder caſe then any propounded by you. We read touching the waſt of the Church in the latter times, <hi>The outward Court cast it out and meaſure it not, for it ſhall be given to the Gentiles, and the holy City ſhall they tread under foot fourty and two moneths,</hi> Rev. 11.2. Here it is plain that the Lord ſpeaketh concerning the deſolation of the Church that ſhall be in all Anti-Chriſtian times. Now ſeeing the Lord hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe things to his people, to the end that they ſhould believe them and prepare themſelves for the tryal, upon the ſuppoſal of this what ſhould a believer do living upon the borders of the Anti Chriſtian deſolation? ſhould he build the Church accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods general Command of preaching the Goſpel, or ſhould he believe that the Church ſhould be deſtroyed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Prophecies. Here are two croſſe wills in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yet it is certain that it is the duty of ſuch a one to preach the Goſpel according to the Commandment, and to leave the viciſſitudes and changes of time unto the Lord himſelf. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>We are a ſweet ſavour in them that are ſaved and in them that periſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.15. And the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> foreſeeing the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that it ſhould certainly come to paſſe, did himſelf believe it, and blame the people for their incredulity. Yet nevertheleſſe in the ordinary way he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them to repent, and to turn from their Idolatry and other ſins that would be the cauſe of their captivity. By all that hath been ſpoken, I now leave to your own conſcience to judge what cauſe you had to raiſe ſuch tragical out-cries againſt the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the two wills, and the inevitable miſery of man which will ſoever he obeyed. When wiſe men ſhall come to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the matter, I believe they will judge that it is rather a pang of your ignorant and blind zeal then of right knowledge. And ſuch an horrid expreſſion you have, <hi>That if a man ſhould ſtudy many years for a deſtroying Principle to diſhonour his Creator, he could not parallel this, which is the ſharpeſt Sword that ever was drawn againſt the righteouſneſſe of God.</hi> pag. 80.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:168516:41"/>Pray Sir, be pacified, there is no harm done. As I have told you before, ſo I ſay again, leave it to God to reconcile his own wills, and let us follow that which he hath revealed in his Word. But you ſay, <hi>The voice of this deſtroyeth all the teſtimonies which God giveth of himſelf. What ſhall we do with thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures where he ſaith, he alters not, if there be a ſecret will of his that controuls his revealed?</hi> page 81. In this alſo you may hold your ſelf content, for the Scriptures which ſay God alters not, are underſtood concerning his will of Decree, which for the moſt part is ſecret to us. But for his revealed will, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of mercies and judgments, he doth many times and upon ſundry occaſions alter his promiſes or threats. For theſe are not made according to his abſolute and eternal Decrees, but are ſuſpended upon outward conditions, as in the caſe of the Ninevites, &amp; <hi>Hezekiah</hi> forealledged. In this caſe the outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of the will of God are but ſubſervient to his eternal Decree. And though they ſeem to our underſtanding to differ, yet they do excellently agree among themſelves. Now laſt of all you come to your chiefeſt argument. <hi>You cannot ſee,</hi> ſay you, <hi>how ſuch a wil can agree with the death of Chriſt and the general tenders of grace.</hi> Theſe are your words, <hi>I fear me too many have a hand in nouriſhing and maintaining this opinion, and then no marvail that ſo many cannot beleeve the record that God gave of his Son. So when God ſweareth by himſelf, as he liveth, he deſireth not the death of him that dyeth, and that he would have no man to periſh, but that he gave his Son a light unto the world that all men thorough him might beleeve, for which purpoſe he taſted death for every man, and not for the Saints onely, but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole world. But theſe ſayings are but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will, and the ſame people that hold this revealed will to be a guide to themſelves, do yet hold a contradiction in the wills of God, ſaying, it is true, God ſaith ſo, but his meaning is not ſo. Now this ſort of people ſhould not beleeve the revealed will at all if they hold his ſecret will to be the Superiour,</hi> pag 81 82. I ſay the ſame as formerly, though the ſecret will of God be the Superiour, yet we are to look to that which is revealed. As for thoſe who affirme that the Lord hath choſen a peculiar num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people from the beginning to ſalvation, If you go to them man by man, I think you will ſcarce finde any one of ſolid
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:168516:42"/>judgment that will tell you we muſt begin at the knowledge of the ſecret will of God. They all ſay, that you muſt begin firſt with the general threats and the general promiſes; and when men are once brought thorough the convictions of the ſpirit to ſee their miſerable and loſt condition, then they ſay they are ſit auditors of the doctrine of the Goſpel in the tenders and the offers of grace. When the promiſe is apprehended by a true and a lively faitht, he next work they ſay i, to attain the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and full aſſurance of faith. And then laſt of all after many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences cometh the aſſurance of election. In this method they proceed in the diſcovery of this myſtery, and not otherwiſe. Though election be firſt in the Lords intention, yet they hold that the aſſurance thereof is and ought to be the laſt in our feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And ſo they expound the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>give all diligence to make your calling and election ſu e,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. And further, though they maintain an aſſurance of election, yet they do not hold an abſolute certainty, but ſuch a one as is lyable to many temptations, deſertions, and eclipſes. Neither do they hold ſuch an immediate aſſurance as though the elect by intuition did look into the Decrees of God; onely they ſtand for a mediate and diſcurſive knowledge of the grace of election by the neceſſary effects and fruits thereof. As you know the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Sunne by the dawning of the day. What other knowledge is this of the ſecret will of God, but that which he himſelf hath firſt made diſcovery of by the fruits?</p>
               <p>As for the ſecret will of God in the Decree of non-election, though they do beleeve according to the Scriptures that there are a great multitude of men that the Lord doth intend to paſſe by, yet if you come to ſingulars, neither you nor any man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving can ſhew who they are in ſpecial. If you ſhall ſay that ſuch and ſuch a one is a notorious evil doer, and therefore a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. <hi>Ananias</hi> thought but little better of <hi>Paul, Lord I have heard of this man how much evil he bath done.</hi> But the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, <hi>go thy way I have made him a choſen veſſel unto me,</hi> Act. 9.14. If ſuch a one hath continued many years under the means of grace, and doth yet ſtand out in impenitency and hardneſſe of heart: this is no infallible argument of non-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, for men may come into the Vineyard at all houres. So
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:168516:42"/>farre forth as men live wickedly we may preach hypothetically and conditionally, according to the revealed will of God, that their courſes are damnable, and as long as they ſo continue they are in the way to damnation: yet we cannot abſolutely pronounce concerning the perſons themſelves, it belongeth onely to God to judge of their final and eternal condition And for that place which you alledg that <hi>God ſweareth that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth not the death of him that dyeth,</hi> I pray you now tel us the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man in our method and way of teaching hat is not a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hearer of this doctrine. Whatſoever God doth intend in his ſecret Decrees concerning the eternal ſtate of men what is that to us? We muſt make the tenders, propoſals and offers of grace according to the termes ſet down in the Goſpel. Indeed, as men do ſubmit to the promiſe and do take Chriſt for their Head, ſo God doth bring about that which he hath determined in his ſecret will. And therefore when you ſpeak concerning this ſort of people, <hi>That they ſhould not beleeve his revealed will at all, if they hold his ſecret will to be the Superiour;</hi> what good reaſon can you ſhew for that? for though the ſecret will of God touching the ſalvation of his elect be the Superiour, yet all the tenders of grace, all faith in the promiſes are but the ordinary way to bring us to ſalvation. Here is no contrariety of will againſt will, but an excellent ſubordination. Becauſe the Lord had many people in the City of <hi>Corinth</hi> that did belong to him in the determination of his ſecret will, therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had a command to preach the Goſpel in that City, and he did continue there the ſpace of a year and ſix moneths, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. But if it be further objected, <hi>how can you pray for the ſalvation of all, ſeeing that the Lord doth determine to paſſe by a great number of men?</hi> I anſwer, though it be ſo, we are to do the duty. <hi>Paul</hi> did know that a greater part of the Jewes ſhould be hardened, and that a remnant onely ſhould be ſaved; yet for all this he did preach the Goſpel, and uſe all means that he might ſave ſome of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> one of the greateſt aſſertors of the prerogative of free-grace, in his book <hi>de correptione &amp; gratiâ</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>We not knowing who belong to the number of the predeſtinate, and who not, ought ſo to be moved with the affection of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:168516:43"/>that we ſhould will all men to be ſaved. And ſo far as it doth appertain to us who are not able to diſtinguiſh the predeſtinate from them who are not predeſtinate, for this very thing becauſe we ought to will all men to be ſaved, we must medicinally uſe ſharp reproof to all men to ſave them from periſhing.</hi> Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> alſo hath theſe words, <hi>moreover of thoſe who are now alive, though the greater part of them ſhould be reprobated, ſeeing this is not known to us, there is nothing doth hinder but we may make ſupplications for all. Vindic. grat. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Crimin.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 9 <hi>Page</hi> 91. Many more teſtimonies I might bring of that kind of people as you call them who maintain the ſecret will of God to be the more prevailing, yet in order to our underſtanding they ſhew that we are to look onely unto that which is revealed. They do with one heart and with one mouth declare that you muſt begin at the lower end of the ladder before you can come to the top. As for the ſecret and the revealed will of God, though this ſeem to us to be contradictory, there is no contradiction. The river that in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſeemeth to go another way, if you follow it by divers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes &amp; turnings it will bring you to the Sea at laſt. But if you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther urge, how can the ſending of Chriſt into the world to dy for the loſt ſonnes of men ſtand with the Decree of election, where ſome onely are choſen to ſalvation? <hi>Anſw.</hi> This point is ſolidly handled by Dr. <hi>Davenant,</hi> in his anſwer to that book that bears the title <hi>Gods love to mankind;</hi> and in another Treatiſe of the death of Chriſt. The ſcope and tenor of the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is to ſhew that the non-elect may be partakers of many fruits of the death of Chriſt, though they are not partakers of that grace which will certainly and infallibly bring them to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;<note place="margin">☞</note> and ſo he doth concord the general attonement with the peculiar Decree of election. But becauſe this point is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly controverted in theſe times, and is as it were the very rock of offence, I will particularly ſhew how farre I can go along with you. Firſt, I do agree that by his death the Son hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the bar out of the way that hinders the ſalvation of man. For God having once made a Law, <hi>in the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> according to the rigour of the Covenant of works and the ſtrictneſſe of divine juſtice there
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:168516:43"/>was no poſſibility for any mans ſalvation. But the Lord Chriſt having once ſatisfied the juſtice of God and removed the barre, there is now a poſſibility for all the loſt ſonnes of men to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they are brought into a ſavable condition, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the ſtrict demands of ſatisfaction according to the firſt Covenant. And this I take to be the natural ſenſe of that place which you and others ſtand ſo much upon, <hi>Who will have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſome for all to be teſtified in due time,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.4, 5, 6. The ſcope of which words is briefly this, that ſeeing the Lord Jeſus Chriſt did give himſelf as a ranſome for all men, there is a poſſibility of ſalvation forall upon termes of repentance and faith. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I do agree with you, that by the death of Chriſt the Lord doth ſhew patience and long-ſuffering to the rebellious to invite them to repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. And though ſince the fall of man the thoughts of his heart were evil from his child-hood; yet reſpect being had to the Mediators blood, typed in the ſacrifice of <hi>Noah,</hi> the promiſe to the whole world was that <hi>the Lord would no more curſe the ground for mans ſake, but ſeed time and harveſt, winter and ſummer, day and night ſhould continue to the worlds end.</hi> Thirdly, I do alſo agree with you in this, that the Lord Jeſus by the ſhedding of his blood hath not onely procured a poſſibility for the loſt ſonnes of men, but alſo at ſeaſons he doth give them ſome portions of ſpirit, enabling them to judge themſelves. And for temporary believers they go ſo far in the participation of the fruits of the death of the Son as <hi>to taſt the good Word of God and the powers of the life to come,</hi> Heb. 6.5. Theſe are the general fruits of the death of Chriſt; and in this ſenſe we may ſay, <hi>that he taſted death for every man.</hi> In what ſenſe then doth Chriſt dye for the elect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? He did ſhed his blood not onely to obtain a poſſibility for them, but that they may be certainly and inſallibly brought to glory. Hence is it that he ſpeaketh concerning his ſheep (for whom he dyed in a ſpecial manner) <hi>My Father that gave them me is greater then all, and none can take them out of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hands,</hi> Joh. 10.29. And in another place, <hi>who ſhall lay
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:168516:44"/>any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth? it is Christ that dyed,</hi> Rom. 8 33, 34. The death of Chriſt for the elect is not only to obtain ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon termes of repentance and faith, or other general fruits of his death, but it is certainly and infallibly to bring them to ſalvation. In relation to this peculiar love the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Christ?</hi> Rom. 8.35. And our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 10.28. <hi>I will give them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man be able to take them out of my hand.</hi> He ſpeaketh theſe things of his ſheep for whom he had layed down his life in that ſpecial ſenſe mentioned before. Having thus cleared all your Objections in this Chapter, we proceed to the next.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Whether <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, or any other mans ſinne doth produce death or condemnation in a natural way.</head>
               <p>TOuching the manner of the thing, how ſinne doth cauſe death, whether death be the natural fruit of ſinne, or whether it doth meerly depend upon the will of him who hath threatned to puniſh ſinne with death, is much diſputed. But, Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> leaving that which may be ſuppoſed, it is too too plain in this Chapter that <hi>you mainly drive at this, to prove that ſinne is not the meritorious cauſe of death, and that Adams ſinne was no cauſe of his condemnation.</hi> And then afterwards going to diſcover the cauſes of judgment; you tell us for the efficient cauſe, God is onely the contriver who doth inflict pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments. For the material cauſe, the creatures are the onely inſtruments. For the formal, it is the manner of judgment coming upon men, the fire by burning, the water by drowning. For the final, it is the declaration of the juſtice of God upon the contemners of his grace. And ſo you conclude, <hi>That ſin
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:168516:44"/>ſinne is no cauſe of puniſhment neither efficient, material, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, nor final,</hi> page 95. 96. And for the meritorious cauſe, <hi>You ſay alſo, that ſinne doth not merit death, but it doth onely prepare, fit and qualifie a man for death, as grace doth for eternal life.</hi> page 106, 107, 108. You do not ſhunne to tell us in the laſt two lines of the Chapter, ſpeaking of eternal life and eternal death, <hi>That God is as ſimply and entirely the Author of the one as of the other.</hi> Page 108. In oppoſition to all this, I do affirme that ſinne is the meritorious cauſe of death, and death is the fruit of ſin. Let us conſider the Scriptures and let us vindicate them from your cavils.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is ſaid <hi>the wages of ſinne is death, but the gift of God is eternal life,</hi> Rom. 6.23. From hence it is plain that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, ſanctification of the Spirit, belief of the truth, and all other things that tend to ſalvation, are the meer gift of God, but the wages of ſinne is death. If death be the wages of ſin, then ſinne muſt be the meritorious cauſe of death. But ſay you, <hi>Though death be the wages of ſinne, yet it is not the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> page 91. Though in ſome caſes we may call that the fruit which is not the wages, yet in the ſenſe of the text, the wages and the fruit are all one. Read but the words going before, <hi>What fruit had you then in thoſe things whereof ye are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed? the wages of ſinne is death.</hi> The fruit and the wages are all one, and the ſenſe of the whole text is this, that ſinne is the meritorious cauſe of damnation. For the ſecond Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6. <hi>To be carnally minded is death, but to be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually minded is life and peace.</hi> Here ſay you, <hi>If it be death it ſelf, it cannot be the cauſe of death.</hi> But, Sir, you are to look to the ſenſe, and not to the ſtrictneſſe of the letter. In ſtrict termes you cannot ſay, that to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace. In this life many that are truly ſpiritual, that have the reality of grace in their heart, have not the peace of grace. The meaning of the text is briefly this, that as peace and life doth follow a ſpiritual mind, ſo death doth follow the carnal mind as the wages and fruit thereof. But here you ſhew your skill at catch-ball. <hi>I confeſſe, ſay you, that he who walketh carnally to his end ſhall receive eternal death; ſo he that lives a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life, ſhall enjoy everlaſting life: But neither the death nor
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:168516:45"/>the life were any branches produced by either, for they came both from God. And as God hath no deſire that any man ſhould ſinne, ſo ſinne hath as little deſire to receive puniſhment.</hi> pag. 92. Still you go on in the ſame way of ſophiſtry. We willingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that he who walketh ſpiritually to the end ſhall receive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, becauſe ſuch walking is the way to eternal life. But the carnal walking is not only the way that leadeth to death; but (by a Metonymie, the effect being put for the cauſe) it is death it ſelf; or, in the way of cauſality, a carnal mind is that which produceth death, and death is the fruit thereof. But whereas you affirme, <hi>that neither death nor life are branches produced either by carnal or ſpiritual walking;</hi> in this you erre. For though a godly walking is not the meritorious cauſe of eternal life, yet a carnal and ſinful walking is the meritorious cauſe of eternal death; Why elſe ſhould it be ſaid, <hi>The wages of ſinne is death?</hi> Maſters uſe to pay their ſervants their wages at night in relation to that which they have deſerved in the day; and for a weeks work, they pay them commonly at the end of the week. The payment of wages hath near relation to the labour of the hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that hath deſerved it. And therefore the Scriptures do uſe this expreſſion, <hi>the wages of ſinne is death,</hi> ſhewing that ſinne is the meritorious cauſe of death, and death is the deſart of ſin. And for that expreſſion of yours, that <hi>death is no branch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>but it cometh meerly from God who inflicteth death;</hi> this I think no pious man can look upon but with a great deal of horror. What is this but to transfer the cauſe of death upon God onely? But if to mend the matter you ſhall ſay that God doth inflict death as the juſt puniſhment of ſin; in ſo ſaying you contradict your ſelf, and blow up your own poſition. For if God doth inflict death as the puniſhment of ſin, then it will follow that ſinne is the meritorious cauſe of death; and death doth not onely come from God, but alſo from the ſinner who hath deſerved it. And ſo you loſe your cauſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Luſt when it hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſinne, and ſinne when it is finiſhed bringeth forth death.</hi> Jam. 1.13, 14. To avoid the force of this Scripture you tell us, <hi>That ſinne doth not bring forth death as luſt doth bring forth ſinne, ſinne is luſts natural ſeed, but death hath no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions by any ſeed of ſinne.</hi> page 94. But Sir, I would
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:168516:45"/>entreat you to leave all windings and ſhifts, deale plainly with the words of the text. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>ſinne when it is finiſhed bringeth forth death.</hi> I do here put it upon you to give a down-right anſwer, ſeeing the words of the Apoſtle are ſo plain. If ſinne doth any way bring forth death then we muſt needs conclude that ſinne is the cauſe of death; and this is the true meaning of the Apoſtle. But ſeeing you bind ſo much upon the Lords inſtitution, who hath threatned death to the ſinner, let us come to the original text, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye the death.</hi> And here, ſetting the Lords prohibition aſide, I do willingly yield that there was no evil in the tree of knowledge of good and evil, if we go to evil in the intrinſecal nature thereof; but the Lord having forbidden it, it was evil to go againſt his Command. In this ſenſe I ſay, though death was threatned by God, yet <hi>Adams</hi> own perſonal ſinne was the meritorious cauſe of death to himſelf and to all his poſterity. And this is the ground of the Apoſtles ſpeech, <hi>By one man ſinne entred into the world, and death by ſinne; and death hath paſt over all men unto condemnation.</hi> You labour in many pages together to prove that <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne was no cauſe of his condemnation; and when all comes to all, <hi>This is your chief ground, that the Lord in his inſtitution did ordain to puniſh ſin and ſinners with death; and therefore ſinne is not the meritorious cauſe of death.</hi> Good Sir, may not both ſtand together as ſocial cauſes? what do you think of the two Malefactors that were han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon the Croſs, the one on the right hand, and the other on the left hand of our Saviour? Were they not both put to death by the ſentence of the Law, yet for all this they were the cauſe of their own condemnation. The converted thief will tell you as much, <hi>Doeſt thou not fear God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation? And we indeed juſtly ſuffer, for we receive the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our deeds.</hi> Luke 23.40, 41. In like manner I ſay, though death was inflicted upon <hi>Adam</hi> as the juſt judgment of God, yet <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne was the cauſe of his own condemnation.</p>
               <p>Now whereas you call death <hi>a righteous branch.</hi> It is true if you look to the ſentence of the juſt Judge, who hath appointed death as the puniſhment of ſinne; yet if you look unto the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of death, he is an enemy: <hi>The laſt enemy that ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:168516:46"/>is death.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.26. Further, in the book of the Revelation, we read, that <hi>after the Beaſt, the falſe Prophet and the Dragon were cast into the lake of fire, then death it ſelf was caſt into the lake of fire.</hi> Rev. 20.14. What is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, but that the Lord Chriſt is Head and King of the Church, and will tread down all his enemies in the ſeveral and reſpective times appointed for their deſtruction, and then laſt of all, death it ſelf ſhall come to be deſtroyed? If death then be an enemy, the laſt enemy, and ſhall be deſtroyed as an enemy, how can you affirme that it is a righteous Branch? Further you argue, <hi>That death cannot be the fruit of ſinne, ſeeing God hath pleaſed to puniſh ſinne with death; ſinne, and puniſhment for ſinne agree no more than light and darkneſſe,</hi> page 91. If this be your opinion, I pray you tell me what do you think of that caſe where God doth puniſh one ſinne with another? <hi>He gave up the Gentiles to vile affections, that they might receive in themſelves that recompence of their error which was meet.</hi> Rom. 1.23 24. If one ſinne may be the puniſhment of another, why do you put ſuch a difference betwixt ſinne and puniſhment as betwixt light and darkneſſe? you have another evaſion to help you our, you ſay, <hi>The very voice or death is enough to ſcare a ſinner from his ſinnes, therefore death is not the natural fruit of ſinne,</hi> page 95. Give me leave to obſerve the ſame way of reaſoning. The Devil, if he ſhould viſibly appear, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſight of him would be enough to ſcare a ſinner from his ſins: Therefore a wicked ſinner when he doth commit ſinne, doth not fulfill the luſts of his father the Devil, which is to go point blank againſt the Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. After this you come to anſwer a weak and incongruous objection of your own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: you feign an adverſary to reaſon in this wile, <hi>If there had been no ſinne, there had been no puniſhment, therefore pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n ſhmext muſt be produced by ſinne,</hi> page 949. In this you deceive your ſelf, we do not argue ſo looſely, to make every antecedent a neceſſary cauſe of that which cometh after for then by the like reaſon you might argue as you do. If there had been no Law, there had been no tranſgreſſion; therefore tranſgreſſion is produced by the Law. We ſay, that ſin doth not go before death as a meet antecedent or occaſion only, but
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:168516:46"/>as the meritorious cauſe of death; the Apoſtle ſaith, ſinne bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth death as the cauſe doth the effect, and the wages of ſinne is death: when the work is done, the wages is to be paid. Laſt of all you come to the particular examples of <hi>Corah,</hi> of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira;</hi> and from thence you reaſon, <hi>If death be the natural fruit of ſinne, why are not all Rebels pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as Corah, all proud men as well as Herod, all guilty of the ſinne of equivocation as well as Ananias?</hi> This is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of your argument, page 99, 100. To all which I make this anſwer, unleſſe they repent they ſhall meet with the ſame righteous judgment of God. The Lord is free in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of judgment as upon thoſe eighteen on whom the Tower in <hi>Siloah</hi> fel; yet that it may appear to you that death is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fruit of ſinne, and that ſinne is the meritorious cauſe of death, our Saviour ſhuts up the matter with theſe words, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you repent, you ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> Luke 13.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But you go on, and ſtrike ſtill upon the ſame ſtring, <hi>If I ſhould allow as much demerit in Adams diſobedience to bring death, as Chriſt had merit in his obedience both active and paſſive to bring life into the world, yet it would not amount to ſuch a pitch to be the onely cauſe. For though the obedience of Chriſt was the cauſe of the coming of life into the world, yet the appointment of God was as principal a cauſe as the obedience of Chriſt. And ſo, though ſinne had been ten thouſand times more ſinful, yet without an Ordinance from God death could never have ſeized upon the world,</hi> page 101. 102, 103. What is all this but a palpable and groſſe miſtake of the queſtion, or as Logicians call it, an <hi>ignorance of the elench?</hi> We do confeſſe, as ſhriſt brought life into the world he brought it in by the inſtitution of his Father; ſo when ſinne brought death into the world, it was by the juſt appointment of God to puniſh ſinne with death. The queſtion that is in debate betwixt us is, whether ſinne be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> cauſe of death as the obedience of Chriſt active and paſſive is the meritorious cauſe of life! If you yield this, (as yield it you muſt we have as much as we do deſire. Next, you enquire, how ſinne may be the cauſe of condemnation? ſuppoſing that it cannot be the principal cauſe, you demand <hi>whether it may be a cauſe in ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination?</hi> And here you tell us, <hi>that ſinne will not be found nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:168516:47"/>ſeeing ſuch cauſes are good in their own nature,</hi> Well then, what is the cauſe? you tell us, ſeeing ſinne is an invention of man and the Devil, <hi>a meere accident that cleaveth to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, man; we may call ſinne an accidental cauſe of condemnation ſeizing upon man found ſinful.</hi> page 105. If this way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning be good, why may not I proceed in the like manner? Heat is an accident in the ſubject, fire; therefore the heat of the fire is a meere accidental cauſe of the boyling of the water. The force of your reaſon is no better when you ſay ſinne is a meere accident in the ſubject, man; therefore it is onely the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental cauſe of condemnation. If you well obſerve the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, you ſhall find it to be very abſurd to call ſin a meere acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental cauſe of condemnation. Condemnation is alwayes ſet in relation to the guilt of ſome ſinne that doth deſerve it, how then can you call ſinne an accidental cauſe of condemnation? The Scriptures ſay, that <hi>the Lord will render to every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works, that they who commit ſuch things are worthy of death;</hi> And many paſſages of the like kind. What will you ſay to all this? Here you have a pretty ſhift to help you out. <hi>Sinne</hi> (ſay you) <hi>puts a man in a ſutable diſpoſition and qualification for death.</hi> page 106. Indeed our Divines when they ſpeak of eternal life, that the Lord will render to every man according to his works, they take the word (worthy) onely for a ſutable qualification: According to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>he hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> Col. 1.12. Though this may be affirmed of the Saints, that they are made meet for eternal life, it were too ſhort and too diminuent an expreſſion to affirme that wicked men onely are made ſuitable to receive vengeance, for then the wicked are no more worthy of eternal death then the Saints are worthy of eternal life;<note place="margin">☞</note> which is plainly to croſſe the Apoſtle, <hi>the wages of ſinne is death, but the gift of God is eternal life.</hi> I cannot then but mention your words with a kind of horrour with which you cloſe the Chapter: ſpeaking of the wicked, they are, ſay you <hi>a ſutable matter to receive vengeance, as Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſutable to receive all the joyes of eternal life. Now the joyes of eternal life are the free-gift of God. All qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, diſpoſitions, frames of ſpirit, though never ſo evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:168516:47"/>in the abundance thereof, do not abate the worth of an hair of eternal life to be the free-gift of God. For there was not the least deſarts in a holy life to the procuring of eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but onely it was the will of God to make eternal life as a Crown to put upon the head of thoſe men that lived holy here, which were fit or ſutable for the Crown of honour. So men that have lived never ſo notoriouſly wicked, rebeling and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming againſt God day after day to their lives end, are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe worthy than perſons fitted as the true ſubjects ſutable for wrath, and God is as ſimply and intirely the authour of the one as the other.</hi> And ſo farre you. Now I leave it to all tender conſciences to underſtand and to give ſentence. We do willingly confeſſe that we cannot merit any thing by our own works in the way to ſalvation, there being ſuch a diſproportion between them and the glory to come. But I do deteſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre that ſpeech of yours, when you ſay <hi>that the greateſt ſinner, who continues ſo all his life long is no otherwiſe worthy of death than a perſon fitted or a ſubject made ſutable for wrath; and that God is as much the cauſe of the damnation of the one as the ſalvation of the other.</hi> If this doctrine of yours be ſound and Orthodox, why may not the wicked in hell caſt all upon God, as the ſole Authour of their miſery, as well as the Saints in heaven aſcribe all to the glory of his free grace? I will uſe your own words though to farre better purpoſe, <hi>If a man ſhould ſtudy many years for a destroying Principle to diſhonour his Creator, he could not parallel this, which is the ſharpeſt Sword that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver drawn againſt the righteouſneſſe of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſtaid the longer upon this point, becauſe you have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo many arguments to prove ſin to be no meritorious cauſe of condemnation, I have more carefully endeavoured to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the truth becauſe this is one of the firſt fundamentals that is put into the heart of the Gentiles: <hi>They knowing the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God againſt them which do ſuch things, that they are worthy of death, not only do the ſame, but have pleaſure in them that do them,</hi> Rom. 1.32. That ſinne is the meritorious cauſe of death, and that a ſinner is worthy of death, is graven in the heart of every man alive: and God at ſeaſons doth ſtirre up the confideration of the guilt of ſinne in the conſcience of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:168516:48"/>the Gentiles, to look after pardon, and to make their peace with God. The firſt convictions of the Spirit do begin with conſiderations of the Godhead and the guilt of ſinne, that ſo men may be brought to ſee their miſery. And yet you teach us here in this Chapter, that ſinne is not the meritorious cauſe of condemnation. Now we proceed to your next Chapter.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="12" type="chapter">
               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> What <hi>Adam</hi> retained of his forfeiture till his death.</head>
               <p>HERE alſo you teach ſuch things as do little leſſe then ſtrike at the foundation. You tell us, <hi>that Adam after the fall, for his body had all the parts and lineaments thereof: He had his ſenſes, and retained his knowledge.</hi> And further you adde, <hi>I make no queſtion but God had ſo ordered the imployments, that he had for Adam ſome of them to be more ſpiritual than ever he had to do before his fall; and then that he ſhould utterly diſable him from the performance thereof, will never be made good by any man under heaven,</hi> page 110. I do fully agree with you in this, that the employment which God had to do for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> after the fall, was as ſpiritual as before. But then conſider the ability does not lie in man, but onely in the Lord Chriſt, and in the Word of promiſe. The true Church doth hold and ever hath held, that the imployment which God hath now for every true believer, is a ſpiritual imployment. Yet they hold it alſo as a truth of the foundation, <hi>that Adam loſt all ability to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good.</hi> But here you think you have an unanſwerable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, for ſay you, <hi>in that ſervice which Adam bad to do, if he was compleatly furniſhed by God, why ſhould I judge that he would employ him in a more hard ſervice, and not afford him ſutable accommodation?</hi> Had God no other way to give <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity ſutable accommodation to obey his commands, but there muſt be a neceſſity in it for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſame abilities after, which he had before the fall? when you thus endeavour to proportion abilities to commands in a natural way you overthrow the ſcope of the Goſpel and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:168516:48"/>the main ſenſe of the Scriptures, which ſhew that all abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to be had from Chriſt. God hath tempered ſalvation, and hath ſo put it into the hands of Chriſt that all that want abilities ſhould go to him in the ſenſe of their own miſery. And to this end he hath ſuffered the firſt man to fall, and to loſe all natural abilities, that ſupply and help may be had from Chriſt onely in the Covenant of grace. This is the main ſcope of the Scriptures. And judge you now whether you do not go againſt the main foundation of the doctrine of Chriſt when you teach ſuch things as theſe, The Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the late Synods confeſſion of faith in the Chapter of free-will, Sect. 2. are (in a manner) as foule as you. For the Synod having laid down this truth concerning <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency, <hi>that then he had a power and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to will that which was good and pleaſing to God, but yet mutably;</hi> the <hi>Cenſors</hi> are not contented with this, but they ſeem to plead for the ſame liberty ſtill in man after the fall. Theſe are their words, <hi>That, man in the state of innocency had freedome and power to will and do that which was good, ſeems to us in ſome ſort to hold true ſtill of all men as they are now borne till they have perſonally and actually ſinned.</hi> If this be ſo, what need is there of a Chriſt to ſanctifie and to regenerate, and to take away the ſinne of the nature? But now we will go along with you. You ſay, <hi>I judge the work that God ſet Adam about before the fall, he had an ability to do after the fall, if God had but given him a command to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the garden again,</hi> page 110. By this account then he had an ability to keep the Covenant of works after his fall. The Covenant of works was that wherein life was promiſed to <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him to his poſterity upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of perfect and perſonal obedience. Will you ſay then that he had ability to keep this Covenant if God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him liberty to return into the garden? Let us hear what ground you have for this <hi>God:</hi> (ſay you) <hi>knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that Adam had not loſt his underſtanding nor his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, for he could tell the uſe of the tree and where it ſtood, that ſhould have cured him of his deadly wound: otherwiſe, the Lord would not have made ſo ſtrong proviſion to prevent
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:168516:49"/>him,</hi> page 111. True indeed, we read that the Lord pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the Eaſt of the garden of <hi>Eden</hi> Cherubims and a flaming Sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life. This Proviſion in the general ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that <hi>Adam</hi> knew the particular place where the tree of life ſtood, and in general what was the uſe of the tree, yet for all this he might be bereaved of his ſpititual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Natural men may altogether be deſtitute of the knowledge of the Spirit, yet judge of external objects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the ſenſes. A Temporary believer who hath loſt his feeling may tell the time when, the place where, and the inſtrument by whom he was firſt wrought upon. Therefore if we take it as granted that <hi>Adam</hi> knew the way to the tree of life, and the general uſe of the tree, this doth not prove him to retaine the ſame ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and internall knowledge which he had before his fall.</p>
               <p>Let us heare the Inventory of <hi>Adams</hi> loſſes as you make the account. You tell us <hi>that Adam forfeited his body and his limbes, and that God would bereave him of all after that nine hundred thirty years were expired.</hi> And you further adde, <hi>that God caſt him out of that pleaſant place of accommodation, that neither he nor his poſterity had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do the will of God in the garden any longer,</hi> page 111, 112. This is the total which you bring in of his loſſes, and this is a very ſhort reckoning. As for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> being caſt out of the Garden, it was a part of his miſery to be deprived of that earthly manſion, but it is the leaſt part of his loſſe. The principal damage which he met withall was internal, in his ſoul, which was more than the loſſe of a thouſand gardens. But we go to your next queſtion.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Whether <hi>Adam</hi> did dye in the ſame day that he did eat the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit.</head>
               <p>TO the clearing of this point you begin with the divers acceptions of the word day. <hi>And then you come to eavil againſt the Lords day, in theſe words.<note place="margin">☜</note> This day ſome affirme that it was the firſt day of the week, but there is little to be ſhewn for that. It is a very private Interpretation, becauſe there is no publick manifeſtation by the Word, but that men are willing to strengthen the opinion and practiſe of a firſt dayes Sabbath with a reference to the changing of Gods Commands, and ſetting up of their own thoughts,</hi> page 114, 115. By this it is clear what your judgment is concerning the Chriſtian Sabbath, but we will briefly clear the point. Firſt, it is of the Law of nature that a due proportion of time be ſet apart for the worſhip of God. Alſo the Lord in his Word by a poſitive and perpetual Command, binding all men in all times, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed one day in ſeven to be kept wholly unto him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20 8, 10, 11. Now this from the beginning of the world to the reſurrection of Chriſt was the laſt day of the week, and from the reſurrection, and ſo downward, it is changed into the firſt day. Upon theſe grounds, therefore if the queſtion be put to us, wherefore do you keep one in ſeven? we plead the morality of the Command. And if it ſhall be ſurther alledged, why keep ye the particular firſt day in memory of the reſurrection of the Lord? Our ground is the perpetual uſe of the Church, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon expreſſe Apoſtolical practiſe, and implicite Apoſtolical precept, which we are ſufficiently able to prove and evince by the collation of foure Scriptures if we were put upon that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But this would be too larg a digreſſion from the matter in hand.</p>
               <p>Next, you come to ſhew the ſenſe of the commination. And here you tell us that <hi>Adam did not dye the ſame day, if the day be taken for the ſpace of twelve or twenty four houres.</hi> This is in plain termes to contradict the ſcope and ſenſe of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:168516:50"/>text. For there it is expreſſely ſaid in the very ſame moment and inſtant of time in which our firſt parents did eat the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit <hi>their eyes were opened, and they ſaw that they were naked,</hi> Gen. 3.7. If you take this for the eyes of their mind, it is moſt clear that their eyes were opened not onely to ſee their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nakedneſſe in the loſſe of the image of God, but alſo to feel the guilt of ſinne as the juſt fruit of their diſobedience. If the opening of the eyes be taken for the eyes of the body, then their eyes were opened to ſee that, which they did not, nor could ſee before. Their nakedneſſe before was a nakedneſſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, innocency and righteouſneſſe, but their nakedneſſe after was a nakedneſſe of diſhonour, of miſery, of ſinne, of provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to ſin. And for the particular time it is expreſſed in the Comination, <hi>in the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye the death.</hi> And accordingly in the ſame inſtant of time when they had eaten the forbidden fruit, <hi>the eys of them both were opened, &amp; they knew that they were naked.</hi> Therefore death &amp; miſery did ſeize upon them the ſame day according to the Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But becauſe you are ſo peremptory in it, that <hi>Adam</hi> did not dye the ſame day if the day be taken for an ordinary day of twelve houres long: For the clearing of this I would intreat you to anſwer me this queſtion, <hi>why did God appear to Adam in the evening in the cool of the day?</hi> If you ſhall ſay, it was to call the man and his wife to account for their diſobedience; I grant this to be true, but it doth not ſatisfie the queſtion, for the particular time. He might have called him to account at any other time; and what neceſſity was there that it ſhould be left upon record that he came to judgment the very ſame day? The Lord had ſaid, in the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye the death, and the ſame day that the forbidden fruit was eaten at evening in the cool or wind of the day (as the Hebrew hath it) the Lord came to inquire after the fact to give ſentence and to execute judgment. In Scripture where promiſes or threats are declared to be fulfilled in ſuch a particular time there the Holy Ghoſt is punctuall in the obſervation of the time. The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be in bondage ſoure hundred years according to the promiſe, <hi>Gen</hi> 15.13, 14. And when that time was fulfilled the very ſame day they came out of the land of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:168516:50"/>
                  <hi>Egypt</hi> with their Armies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 41, 42. So our Lord and Saviour did ſignifie to his Diſciples that he ſhould be crucified and ſlain, and the third day riſe again. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. And how careful are all the Evangeliſts to repeat the time of the reſurrection, that it was on the firſt day of the week, the third day after his paſſion? And ſo in the preſent caſe, when it is ſaid <hi>in the day that thou eateſt thereof ſhalt thou dye the death,</hi> to the fulfilling of this the eyes of our firſt parents were opened the very firſt day: And the Lord came to execute judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them for their diſobedience the evening of the ſame day. After all this let us now hear what expoſition you do give of the text. <hi>Though Adam (ſay you) did not dye the ſame day as he did eat of the forbidden fruit, yet he forfeited his life to the Lord of the great Charter of the world, he was then in a capacity to dye, he did then fall under the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death. As in the Engliſh, ſuch a man is a dead man becauſe he is condemned by the ſentence of the Law.</hi> That which you ſay is true, and it is in effect that which I teach: but according to your ſenſe it is not the whole truth. For when the Lord ſaith <hi>in the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> he doth not ſpeak this onely of a capacity of dying but of an actual ſeizing of death: for he was ſtruck with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual death the very ſame day he ſinned. And for a temporal death likewiſe, though there was not a preſent diſſolution of the ſoul from the body, yet preſently he fell under the curſe, to conflict with Armies of diſeaſes which ſhould never leave him till they had brought him to his grave. <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread untill thou return unto the ground, for out of it was thou taken, for duſt thou art and unto duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi> Chap. 3. ver. 19. But now you further adde, <hi>If Adam had dyed the ſame day he could not have tilled the ground, he could not have lived ſo long as to ſee a ſon of his own.</hi> To all this I agree, if you take death in the moſt ſtrict ſenſe for the actual diſſolution of the ſoul from the body, but what ground have we ſo to limit the words of the text? I have ſaid before that God did ſmite him the ſame day with ſpiritual death, and for a temporal death he came under the dominion and reign of it. In that famous place
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:168516:51"/>when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>by one man, ſinne entred into the world, and death by ſinne, and death hath paſſed over all men to condemnation,</hi> Rom. 5.12. He doth here ſpeak of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate reign of death. <hi>Death reigned from Adam to Moſes over them that had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſſion,</hi> ver. 14. And in the cloſe of all, <hi>as ſinne hath reigned to death, ſo might grace reign thorough righteouſneſſeunto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life,</hi> v. 21. Therfore the ſame day that <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, though he lived to till the ground, and to beget children after his own image, yet he and all his fell immediately under the reign of death: ſo that all who are now born into the world, infants as well as others, are under the reigne of death by the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the firſt man. Having given the true ſenſe of the Scripture, we will take a view of your interpretation. And here you ſay,<note place="margin">☞</note> that <hi>Adam did dye the ſame day, though he lived nine hundred thirty nine yeares after.</hi> And to make good this ſtrange gloſſe of yours you tell us that <hi>God did not preſcribe any quantity of houres, but hath declared that a thouſand yeares are as one day in his account,</hi> page 118. I muſt indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that a day is taken ſometimes for a year, ſometimes for a greater revolution of time, as may be ſeen in the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Scriptures. But the ſcope of the text is plainly to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a literal ordinary day, as we have formerly proved. And ſtrange it is that the Lord in the denunciation of judgment ſhould go to the typical and parabolicall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions uſed in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle.</p>
               <p>After this you come to enquire, <hi>whether Chriſt by his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring did not prevent the falling of death upon Adam?</hi> And you reſolve it in the negative. For ſay you, <hi>either Adam muſt ſuffer, or the Word of God, ſeeing God had once declared the ſentence, thou ſhalt ſurely dye. In caſe then he ſhould give his Son to prevent the death of Adam, there had been a clear contradiction,</hi> page 119. In the commination there are ſome things which I do acknowledge to be infallible as the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> which alter not; and therefore to make good the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, all that are now born into the world after the courſe of natural generation, are borne in the ſtate of ſpiritual death, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:168516:51"/>to the miſeries of nature, and ſhall inevitably be brought to temporal death at laſt. All theſe things do hold by vertue of the firſt ſentence: yet you muſt take heed that you go no further, becauſe the ſecond man hath all fulneſſe of grace to repair the loſſes brought in by the firſt. By his intervening patience and long-ſuffering is extended to all the ſonnes of men. And therefore whatſoever you ſuggeſt to the contrary, there is indeed and in truth no contradiction between the ſentence <hi>in the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> and the delay thereof in a qualified ſenſe. In ſome particulars long-ſuffering may be extended, and yet in others there may be a ſpeedy exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the ſentence. But you go on, <hi>ſeeing God would not have Adam to come near the tree of life, therefore he would not have him to be free from death that way,</hi> page 119. Neither do we maintain that it was the purpoſe of God to free <hi>Adam</hi> in that manner that he ſhould not taſte of a temporal death. He came under the dominion of that death the ſame day he ſinned, and the moſt holy Saints that are muſt all dye before they can be raiſed again, to ſet forth the truth and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Lords commination. Yet for all this at preſent the ſtroke was ſtayed by the Mediators blood, and long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was extended to men, that ſalvation might be had by the Covenant of grace. As for the tree of life, it is moſt true, that God did forbid <hi>Adam</hi> acceſſe to that tree, not abſolutely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not have him to recover life, but becauſe he had provided another way for the reſtoring of man by Chriſt the promiſed ſeed. He would not come to the moſt extream and final execution of the ſentence, becauſe his purpoſe was to have a poſterity upon the earth, and a ſeminary for the Church. Further, you argue, <hi>there was a neceſſity for Adam to dye, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe Christ could not make him alive,</hi> page 119. Here you miſtake the ſtate of the queſtion, we agree that Chriſt did not dye ſimply to free man that he ſhould not fall into the duſt, but only to raiſe him from the duſt again. It was neceſſary to fulfill the truth of the commination, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould return to duſt, but it was not neceſſary that he ſhould return to duſt the very ſame day. It was neceſſary that he ſhould fall under the reign of death, and under a neceſſity of dying the ſame day he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:168516:52"/>ſinned, and this to continue to the reſurrection of the juſt: <hi>Then this mortal ſhall put on immortality, and this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ſhall put on incorruption.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.53. The Apoſtle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſaith, <hi>when he ſhall change theſe vile bodies that they may be made like his glorious body.</hi> Phil. 3.21. All the bodies of the Saints ſhall be made like the body of Chriſt as now it is in glory. But how did the bodies of the Saints begin to be vile bodies? By vile bodies he doth mean theſe corruptible ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles of the ſoul, lyable to diſeaſes and to all the miſeries of nature. But when did this vileneſſe and miſery begin ſeeing they were not made vile by creation. They began to be vile bodies the ſame day that <hi>Adam</hi> did ſin, they have been ſo ever ſince, and they muſt continue ſuch unto the reſurrection, and then the bodies of the Saints ſhall be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the bodie of Chriſt in glory, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3 <hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Whether <hi>Adam</hi> did dye a ſpiritual death yea or no?</head>
               <p>IN the diſcovery of this point you obſerve this method. Firſt you ſhew what ſpiritual life is. Secondly, you reſolve upon the queſtion. For your deſcription of ſpiritual life, though you miſerably confound the Scriptures, we will take it in the beſt ſenſe, for ſuch a life as hath the Spirit for the cauſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. <hi>John</hi> 6.63. <hi>Col.</hi> 33. But you erre in your application, when you uſe ſuch an expreſſion as this, <hi>that Adam had not ſuch a cup of water in all his foure Rivers.</hi> You ſay alſo, that <hi>he could not ſavour the voice of the reſurrection from the dead: for the goodneſſe of a Saviour muſt be reſented by thoſe that are loſt, but Adam knew no ſuch need.</hi> page 122. Your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is fallacious, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſpiritual life in the ſame way as the Saints now have, therefore he had no ſpiritual life at all. He might have ability to love Chriſt as Lord Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:168516:52"/>Further you ſay <hi>that the voice of forgiveneſſe of ſinne was a ſtranger to him.</hi> Well, let this be admitted, it doth not prove the point neither. Sickneſſe it ſelf was a ſtranger to <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, will you inferre then that there were no herbs for medicine, and that the Lord did not create the herb of the field with a medicinal vertue? So in the like caſe, what if remiſſion of ſinne and the way of pardon of ſinne by Chriſts blood was a thing hidden from <hi>Adam,</hi> as being not compatible with his condition; will you inforce from hence a want of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity in him to underſtand the myſtery of ſalvation by Chriſt? or will you affirme from hence, that he was a meere carnal man before his fall? Take heed that by theſe and ſuch like poſitions you do not reflect upon God himſelf. The Apoſtle ſaith, the <hi>carnal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the Law of God neither indeed can be,</hi> Rom. 8. ver. 6, 7. If you go to the Original of this enmity or non-ſubjection, and ſay it did proceed from the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> you do agree with us. But if you go higher, and ſtand upon it that <hi>Adam</hi> was a meere natural man by the condition of his creation, then you will lay the blame upon God that ſet him in ſuch a ſtate of enmity; and whither will you go in the iſſue if you maintain ſuch poſitions as theſe?</p>
               <p>But to make good your aſſertion you argue, <hi>The firſt man is of the earth earthy; the ſecond man is the Lord from heaven. So though Adam was the firſt man, &amp; a living man yet it was not a living ſoul that proveth that Adam had a quickned Spirit.</hi> page 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. But in this you do miſerably ſoobiſticate. For though the Apoſtle doth draw a parallel between both the <hi>Adams;</hi> If you do well ponder the Scripture, you ſhall finde that the parallel doth not ſtand ſo much between <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall as between the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; the ſecond after the fall. 2ly. upon good conſideration you ſhall finde that the Apoſtle in this Scripture doth not ſpeak ſo much concerning the Spirit of God in the ſoules of the Saints as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſpirituality of their bodies that ſhall be at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. <hi>It is ſown in corruption, it is raiſed in incorruption, it is ſown in diſhonour, it is raiſed in glory? it is ſown a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body. There is a natural body and there is aſpiritual body,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.43, 44. If then you will
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:168516:53"/>needs conclude <hi>Adam</hi> to be a carnal man before his fall, becauſe his body was not made a ſpiritual body; by the ſame reaſon you muſt conclude all the Saints that have ever been ſince the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, to be carnal men, and abſolutely deſtitute of the work of the Spirit. For the bodies of the Saints are yet car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and muſt abide in their incarnality till the reſurrection of the dead. But whereas you build ſo ſtrongly upon that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>the first man Adam was made a living ſoul the laſt man Adam was made a quickning Spirit,</hi> verſe 45. This doth not prove the firſt man to have been meerely carnal or abſolutely void of the Spirit before his fall. For it is not the ſcope of the Apoſtle in this Scripture to ſpeak of the excellency of man made after the image of God, but onely of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ſtate of the body as it ſtandeth in immediate relation to that immortal condition which it ſhall have at the reſurrection of the dead. And whereas it is ſaid the ſecond man was a quickning Spirit, this is meant principally of the divinity of Chriſt, by and thorough which he will raiſe the dead. So then, if you will build upon this ground, and argue from hence, that the firſt man was a meere carnal man, becauſe he was not a quickning Spirit, by the ſame principle you muſt conclude that all the Saints living are carnal men. For of what one of them may it be affirmed that he is a quickning Spirit, who by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and divinity is able to raiſe the dead? But if you will make a right analogy, let us compare the things that ought to be compared. Firſt, let us conſider what the firſt man was before his fall, and what the Saints are as renewed by grace. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let us compare what the firſt man might have been if he had eaten of the tree of life, and what the Saints ſhall be at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead. For the firſt of theſe, if you ſpeak of the Saints as renewed by grace, though their bodies be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, they are ſpiritual in reſpect of the inward man. The ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, though his body was made of the duſt, yet by grace and ſpecial favour he did carry the image of God. For the ſecond, if you ſhall affirme that all the bodies of the Saints ſhall be made immortal and ſpiritual at the reſurrection, conſider what the body of <hi>Adam</hi> might have
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:168516:53"/>been if he had continued in his obedience and eaten of the tree of life. If you would make a right collation between ſtate and ſtat, ethe parallel ſhould runne in theſe termes. But becauſe you ſtand ſo ſtrongly upon this expreſſion, that <hi>the firſt man is of the earth earthy; the ſecond man is the Lord from heaven;</hi> ſeeing you will have all this to be applied to <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, I pray you reſolve me this queſtion, ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>as we have born the image of the earthy ſo ſhall we bear the image of the heavenly,</hi> Who are they that bear the image of <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall? I think if you were put to it, you could not produce any one inſtance in all <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africa,</hi> or <hi>America</hi> that ever ſtood up after this ſimilitude. The ſcope of the text is onely concerning man after the fall, and how the reſurrection of the dead doth take away that death which is brought in by the fall. In the cloſe of the Chapter you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this queſtion, <hi>whether was not Adam to have dyed an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal death for eating of the forbidden fruit?</hi> For the clearing of the queſtion let us diſtinctly ſet down how the three kinds of death did ſeize upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and how they come upon all his branches. Firſt, for ſpiritual death, it is evident that he died this death as ſoon as he did eat of the forbidden fruit. For the temporal death, he fell under the reign of it the ſame day he ſinned. And for eternal death, though according to the truth of the commination, <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity ſhould have dyed, the Lord Chriſt ſtepping in did ſet a ſtop to the ſentence. And therefore for the cauſe of the condemnation of man, it is now principally and immediately for the neglect of the grace of God that ſhould lead him to repentance. But you adde further, <hi>I can ſafely ſay, that if Adam was to have dyed an eternal death, and that by the appointment of God, then Chriſt neither would nor could have ſtept in; nay he could not have lifted up his little finger to have helped Adam or his poſterity.</hi> page 125. I anſwer, If God had decreed in his ſecret purpoſe that <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity ſhould have dyed the death, in ſuch a caſe Chriſt neither would nor could have ſtept in to croſs the Decree of God; but Sir, who is the man that doth maintain that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition? For my part, I take the Decree of God to be one thing, and the outward denunciation of judgment to be another. For
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:168516:54"/>the Decree, that cannot be changed, but the ſentence may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve alteration according to divers outward circumſtances and conditions that may occurre. Beſides, if you ſhould build ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſtrongly upon the letter of the text, we can eaſily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the truth of the commination, in ſaying that <hi>Adam</hi> might dy the death the ſame day he ſinned,<note place="margin">☞</note> though the Lord was not pleaſed preſently to inflict death in all its kinds. From all which we do conclude, if the Lord Chriſt came to free men from the reign of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15. We may eaſily gather that <hi>Adam</hi> brought himſelf and all his poſterity under the dominion of that ſyrant: and ſo he and all his ſhould have dyed that kind of death if the Lord Chriſt had not ſtepped in. But you go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to deface this ſpeech in the end of the Chapter, <hi>for if in caſe that Christ had not stepped in there had been no recovery, this were to exclude all other means, and to limit the holy One of Iſrael.</hi> page 126. Sir, I would intreat you not to make the doctrine of ſalvation odious by picking quarrels againſt words. For we do not peremptorily define that there was no other way poſſible to ſave man unleſſe Chriſt had ſtepped in; we leave it onely to the Lord himſelf to judge of the ſeveral poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities of the ſalvation of man. This onely we affirme, ſo far as it is revealed to us, the preſent is the moſt excellent way to ſatisfie the juſtice of God and to ſhew abundant mercy. And though you now, as others before you, go about to caſt an hatred upon the doctrine of the Church in the points of the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> original ſinne, free-will, and the like; I muſt tell you, if you and they would not tear thoſe things aſunder which ſhould be joyned together, if you would compare one thing with another, you ſhould find that there is nothing ſo deformed in the ſtate of the firſt man, but there is that in the ſecond which will anſwer all. But here is the miſery, you look upon the myſtery of ſalvation in ſome broken pieces and parts onely, and do not conſider the whole compages or ſum of the truth in one body. We will now proceed to your next Chapter.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Whether <hi>Adams</hi> posterity were guilty of his tranſgreſſion,</head>
               <p>IN this Chapter you endeavour to make good the purity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the freedome of all infants from original ſin; you do not, as the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> extenuate the matter, but after the manner of the ancient <hi>Pelagians</hi> you deny the ſinne of the nature. And here you do not go alone. The Confeſſion of faith, lately ſet forth by the thirty ſeparate Congregations, doth not ſpeak one word of this ſin of the nature. If we go to the beginning of their book, (where all other Chatechiſmes do ſhew the miſery of man by nature) they are altogether ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the point of original ſinne. In the middle where they ſpeak of the grace of Chriſt there is not one ſyllable concerning the grace that doth regenerate or purge out the ſinne of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In the third and laſt part of the book when they come to duties after regeneration they ſpeak nothing of the great work of the mortification of the Old man and the putting on of the New man, but onely of dipping, and baptizing Diſciples, and of the manner of living in their way of Church-memberſhip. And thus one great errour at the foundation doth in a manner overthrow the whole building of the Chriſtian faith. And this is the wofull ſtate of the ſeparate Congregations with us. Neither are theſe Churches in ſo bad a condition, but the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminors and Cenſors of the late Confeſſion of faith ſet forth by the Aſſembly of Divines, theſe clancular Authours (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they be) have further ſwarved from the truth.<note place="margin">☜</note> For they in their late <hi>Examen</hi> do not onely maintain the purity of the natural birth, but alſo have many other poſitions and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable tenents. I will therefore take the liberty to joyn all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And therefore, Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> where you and they do agree one anſwer ſhall ſerve both, and where they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:168516:55"/>thing which you have not touched I ſhall begin with them as aſſoon as I have ended with you.</p>
               <p>Before I come to anſwer your arguments, let me put both you and them in mind of your ſophyſtical dealing.<note place="margin">☞</note> For neither you in your treatiſe, nor they in their Examen do men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our chiefeſt argument drawn from <hi>Job.</hi> 3. Theſe are the words of our Saviour to <hi>Nicodemus, Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, except a man be born again he cannot ſee the Kingdome of God. Nicodemus ſaith unto him; how can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the ſecond time into his mothers womb and be borne? Jeſus anſwered verily, verily, I ſay unto thee except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdome of God. That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit. Marvail not that I ſaid unto thee you muſt be borne again,</hi> verſe 3.4, 5, 6, 7. Theſe words are moſt plain and ſignificant to prove the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the natural birth, and the neceſſity of the new birth, as every one that readeth may eaſily underſtand. I do mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell then that you ſhould overpaſſe this place in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>But let us now come to the meaning of the text; to prove the neceſſity of Regeneration our Saviour doth uſe this <hi>medium,</hi> that which is borne of fleſh is fleſh. Becauſe man is polluted in his natural birth, therefore he needs have a new birth. By <hi>fleſh</hi> we do not underſtand that maſſe and lump of the body which we carry about us, for in it there is neither good nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; but our Lord Chriſt doth here intend the corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as it is oppoſed to the ſanctifying work of the Spirit: for ſo fleſh and Spirit are commonly oppoſed in Scripture. This may more particularly be ſeen in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. in the beginning of the Chapter. Therefore our Saviours argument is much in effect, becauſe the nature of man is defiled with original ſinne from the very birth the remedy muſt be proportionable to the diſeaſe,<note place="margin">☞</note> it is neceſſary that every one that ſhall enter into the Kingdome of heaven muſt be new born. There be divers cauſe? that do bring men to a habit of ſinne, and there are divers means to be uſed to break of ſuch habits. Firſt, men are brought
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:168516:55"/>to a cuſtome in ſinning by example; and therefore the Word commands that we ſhould turn away from ſuch evil communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations as will corrupt good manners. Secondly, men are brought to a habit in ſinne by long cuſtome, which is as it were a ſecond nature: and therefore the Scripture ſpeaks that we ſhould break off ſuch kind of cuſtomes by a kind of violence. Thirdly, men come to a practiſe of ſinne by temptation, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> ſaw the wedge of gold and the babyloniſh garment and coveted it: and therefore the Scriptures do every where ſay that we ſhould reſiſt the temptations of the world, the allurements of the fleſh, and to pray unto the Lord that he would not lead us into temptation. Theſe are in part the cauſes of the habit and practiſe of ſin, but they are not the original &amp; the principal cauſe; that lies higher, in the natural birth: There is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Regeneration by the Spirit becauſe all that are borne in the natural way are defiled with ſinne. They then who maintain the purity of the natural birth as the Examiners, Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> and the ſeparate Churches do, overthrow the doctrine of the foundation of Chriſt. Now, Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">☞</note> let us come to your arguments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you ſay, <hi>we could not ſinne in Adam, our ſouls and bodies were not together in him, and how we could commit ſinne you know not, therefore believe not.</hi> page 127. But Sir, if you would ſeriouſly conſider the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>by one man ſinne entred into the world, &amp;c.</hi> You ſhould finde that all then were in one publick man, and ſinned in him; and this is the reaſon which the Apoſtle giveth why death paſſed univerſally upon all men, becauſe <hi>in one all have ſinned;</hi> his one act was the act of all. But for more abundant confirmation let us conſider the ſcope of the text. The drift of the Apoſtle is to draw a parallel between both the <hi>Adams,</hi> Friſt in thoſe points wherein they do agree. Secondly, in thoſe wherein they do diſagree. For the points of agreement, the moſt remarkable to the purpoſe in hand are theſe. Firſt, the two <hi>Adams</hi> are deſcribed as two perſons which are the roots to their ſeveral and reſpective poſterities. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> is a root to all his branches, and the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is a root to all branches. I marvail then what deluſion hath ſeized upon the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:168516:56"/>Examiners, who do poſitively maintain, that the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> is not here intended as he was the Father of us all. Secondly, they are deſcribed by the plurality of branches, as the firſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had a multiplicity of branches out of him, ſo the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had a plurality of branches out of him. And therefore the Apoſtle doth elegantly proceed in the collation: <hi>as by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of one, many be dead; ſo the gift of grace which is by one man Jeſus Chriſt hath abounded unto many. As by one mans offence death reigned by one: much more they which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive abundance of grace ſhall reign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle doth compare one <hi>Adam</hi> to one Chriſt; <hi>Adam</hi> the root of all his branches, Chriſt the root of all his branches. Thirdly, they are ſet forth by the paſſage of the common ſap out of each root into its branches, reſpectively. And therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaketh concerning the firſt <hi>Adam, by one man ſinne entred into the world, and death by ſinne, and death paſſed over all men.</hi> The common ſap then that paſſed out of the firſt man into all his branches, is firſt ſinne, and then death by ſinne. By ſinne is here principally meant original ſinne and all other ſinnes that flow from this as the fountain. But if further enquiry be made concerning the paſſage of ſin &amp; death into all the branches that come of <hi>Adam,</hi> the paſſage is not all at one and the ſame inſtant. It is now five thouſand ſix hundred years ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and in all this time original ſinne hath been in continual flux and ſucceſſion. As in ſeveral generations men come to be born, ſo they actually participate of the ſap that comes from the firſt root. The like may be ſaid of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> and of his branches. <hi>They which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhall reigne in life by one Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> ver. 17. The ſap then that cometh from Chriſt as the common root, is grace and ſpiritual life; this doth flow out of him into all his branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. And for the paſſage thereof, it is not all at one time, but as men come to receive the gift of righteouſneſſe and to be born anew they come to the actual fruition thereof. For, let the death of Chriſt be never ſo largely tendred to the loſt ſonnes of men, there is no actual participation of him till he be received by faith. The words of the text are moſt emphatical and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:168516:56"/>
                  <hi>They which receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteouſneſſe ſhall reigne in life.</hi> As who would ſay in plainer termes, they only ſhall reign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt who do particularly receive the gift of righteouſneſſe which is generally offered. This is the undoubted meaning of the text. And therefore for you to ſay that we could not ſinne in <hi>Adam,</hi> our ſoules and bodies not being in him, how do you anſwer the ſcope of the text? <hi>by the diſobedience of one, many were made ſinners, by one man ſinne entred into the world. Adam,</hi> is here ſet forth as the root of all his branches, and al the branches were in him as the firſt publick man. What can you or the Examiners ſay to this?</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. you ſay <hi>that we had no Law in Adam. Now where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion; &amp; if we had received any Law, it must have been made known to us, but there was none made known to us, and therefore there was no Law.</hi> page 127. To this I rejoyn,<note place="margin">☜</note> if there was no Law given to us in <hi>Adam,</hi> how come we to be guilty of his tranſgreſſion? how come we to bear the burden of his ſinne? why doth the Apoſtle ſpeak ſo plainly, <hi>by the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of one, many were made ſinners?</hi> We muſt then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily come to affirme this for a truth, that the Law was given to <hi>Adam</hi> as a publick man, and in him to all his poſterity. And, whereas you ſay, <hi>that there was no Law made known to us at that time, therefore we had no intereſt in the Law:</hi> why do not you infer by the like reaſon, when the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſuffered death upon the Croſſe, becauſe at that very time the merit of his death was not made known, you had no part or portion in that death which was one thouſand ſix hundred years before you were born. If you will be loth to ſtand to the latter, to loſe your priviledge by the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> I pray you give us leave to maintain the dammage that was brought in by the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> And yet further; to take away all ſcruples from tender conſciences, if it might ſeem harſh for all the ſonnes of men to periſh by the diſobedience of one man, eſpecially when the Law was not made known to them in their own individual perſons, but in the common root of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, let us conſider how the ſecond man came as a remedy to free the ſame miſerable ſonnes of men from the ſtate of ſinne
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:168516:57"/>and death, eſpecially when they neither thought nor knew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing concerning the means of their ſalvation. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our miſery by <hi>Adam,</hi> doth amplifie and ſet forth the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt in the fulneſſe thereof. Now then when the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminers and you both go about to extenuate the miſery of the fall, you do rob Chriſt of the glory of his grace.</p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>The branch hath not any thing, but what it hath by dependance upon the tree. Now it is not ſo with us; for that which we call the Principal part of man, his ſoul or ſpirit was not dependant upon Adam, but had his dependancy from the very ſame fountain from whence Adam received his, even from God himſelf.</hi> p. 128. Here I confeſs there is a great queſtion concerning the manner of the propagation of Original ſin, and men do wearie themſelves very much to find out, <hi>whether</hi> the ſoul be by infuſion or by traduction? But <hi>I</hi> ſee no cauſe why we ſhould intangle our ſelves in that difficultie.<note place="margin">☞</note> For, whether the ſoul be infuſed, or whether it be traduced, or which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be conveyed, we muſt neceſſarily affirme in the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all flux of original ſinne from father to child, each father doth propagate it to his child, as <hi>Adam</hi> did to the whole poſterity. If this be not a real truth, what ſhall we make of the ſpeech of our Saviour, <hi>that which is born of the fleſh is fleſh?</hi> Joh. 3.6. The Father then doth propagate the corruption of nature to his child as he himſelf did firſt receive it by propagation. We muſt needs then yield the truth of the thing, though there be ſome difficulty in the diſcovery of the manner. But that which doth very much ſatisfie me in this point is the conſideration of that ſpeech to <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him to all mankind; <hi>be fruitful and multiply, repleniſh the earth and ſubdue it,</hi> Gen. 1.28. From whence I gather, that the propagation of mankind doth chiefly depend upon this promiſe eſtabliſhed in the beginning. And therefore ſuppoſe that be true which you ſay, that the ſoul doth come immediately from God, the queſtion is whether in matter of generation, in matter of union of the ſoul with the body, in matter of propagation of the kind, the child doth not depend upon the father as the branch doth upon the root. And doth not the Lord continue ſtill to performe that promiſe that he made in the beginning? Surely, by what power the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:168516:57"/>earth doth continue to bring forth herbs, and every thing doth fructifie according to its kind; by the ſame ordinance, bleſſing and promiſe of God doth the father beget the child, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a poſterity upon the earth. To the right ſolution of the queſtion then, we muſt give a double anſwer. For if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the firſt place, why a man doth generate a man? It is from the Ordinance and bleſſing of God, and from that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Law, increaſe and multiply. But if it be further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, why a ſinful father doth continue to beget a ſinful child? the traduction of original ſinne is from <hi>Adam,</hi> the common root of the corruption of nature ever ſince the fall. For the fountain being corrupted the corruption doth go down the ſtream, and is in perpetual flux and ſucceſſion from the Spring head. But to make the matter good, you go on, <hi>If the ſoules and ſpirits of all that ſtock that came from Adam ſhould have been lineally derived, then they muſt have returned again to him,</hi> page 228. This doth not follow for by the like reaſon, why do you not argue concerning the branches and leaves of all the trees and foreſts in the world, becauſe they have their deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the root therefore they muſt return into the root a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; But you adde further, <hi>admit</hi> (ſay you) <hi>we had ſuch a being in Adam as the branches had in the tree, and produce actions in a natural way, being prone thereunto, yet that which is to be expected muſt have been ſuch fruits as were natural to the tree and no other; but ſinne was no natural fruit, but an accident,</hi> page 129. Indeed if you take nature in its firſt eſſence and inſtitution, it is good, and all ſinne is unnatural and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental; but if you take nature in its vicious qualities, as it is ſince the fall, then it is depraved in <hi>Adam,</hi> and our immediate parents are ſo many conduit-pipes of the corruption of nature. If this be not ſo, what can be the meaning of our Saviours words, <hi>that which is born of fleſh is fleſh?</hi> This ſheweth plainly that <hi>Adam</hi> is not onely the root of nature, but alſo ſince the fall a root of the corruption of nature; and upon this ground lyes a neceſſity of regeneration, or having a new nature from Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, you ſay, <hi>If we muſt own all Adams actions ſinful, as our acts, then pray give me leave to appropriate as large a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:168516:58"/>portion in all his good actions. For why ſhould I not plead for as much propriety in all his good actions, as ſome will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me I have in all his evill actions, ſeeing I was as much in him before the fall, as ſince? And then I might ſay as well, that I walked in the Garden, and dreſt it, and gave names to all creatures,</hi> page 129. If this will give you content, I know nothing to the contrary but we may affirme, that all mankind were in <hi>Adam</hi> when he walked in the Garden, and gave names to all cattell. And without queſtion you ſhould have had as great a part in his good actions if he had ſtood, as now you have a ſhare in the evil of that action, by which he fell. To make this appear, in that ſtate as we are now reſtored by Chriſt, Man hath Lordſhip and Dominion over the creature. If you will fetch this dominion from that great Charter, <hi>Let them have dominion over the fiſh of the Sea, the fowle of the aire, &amp;c.</hi> Gen. 1.26. Then you muſt needs conclude, that the priviledge which was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> was given to all his poſterity. Yea, in that particular caſe, when the Lord brought all creatures to <hi>Adam</hi> to ſee what names he would give them, he did bring the creatures to him, as to the head of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and he not onely in his own private, but in their publick right did give names to all cattell. The like may be ſaid of the inſtitution of marriage in the beginning, &amp; of a mans leaving his father and mother, and cleaving to his wife: This did not ſo immediately concern <hi>Adam</hi> in his own perſon, as all mankind that ſhould come of him in ſucceeding generations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.4.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, you ſay, <hi>If all men did ſinne in Adam when he did eate the forbiden fruit, why might it not as well be ſaid, when Adam beleeved, I beleeved; when Adam repented, I repented?</hi> page 130. I anſwer, the caſe is not equal, for when <hi>Adam</hi> did eate the forbidden fruit, he did this as a publick perſon, as the root of all mankind: but when he did believe, he did that as a particular member of Chriſt. I may ſay on the other ſide, when Chriſt ſuffered upon the Croſſe to ſatisfie the juſtice of God, this was all one as if <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> themſelves had ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the juſtice of God. What Chriſt did, he did for them, and when he did it, they did it in him and by him. The like
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:168516:58"/>anſwer may be given to that queſtion, why do not the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate propagate grace as well as original ſinne? The anſwer is plain, piety is not hereditary, as original ſinne is, neither doth holineſſe come into us by nature, but by grace; not generation but regeneration doth intitle us to ſalvation. And therefore in the aforementioned caſe, when <hi>Adam</hi> did beget <hi>Cain</hi> in his own likeneſſe, he did not beget him as the ſonne of his faith, but the ſonne of his corrupt nature. The ſame may be ſaid of the natural Progeny of all believers, they are born in original ſinne as well as the children of Infidels. The Jew that was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed himſelf, begat one that was uncircumciſed. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>a poor and a weak ſhift of the Examiners,</hi> (who, to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the force of that Scripture, I was conceived in ſinne and born in iniquity,) do not ſhunne to tell us <hi>that Davids father was a pious man in Iſrael, and his mother was a godly. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, and being both of them well grown in grace before they begat this their youngest ſonne, they were more like to convey grace and holineſſe (if that be communicable) than ſinne unto him.</hi> Be like then, <hi>theſe new Divines</hi> think the grace of God runnes in a blood, at leaſt wiſe, that it is a more probable truth than to beleeve the propagation of the ſin of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Now you come to open the text, and here ſay you, <hi>If we had all committed ſinne in Adam, then of what uſe were theſe words (by the offence of one?) I do not finde ſuch a ſaying parallelled, viz that one mans offence can be called all mens act that followed him, and that without their knowledge and conſent.</hi> page 131. If in this point you would ſeriouſly ponder the Scripture, you will have your doubts reſolved. The words of the Apoſtle are plain, <hi>by the diſobedience of one, many were made ſinners.</hi> How came they to be ſinners, to have the guilt of ſinne imputed, and original ſinne derived with all the effects and fruits thereof, but by the diſobedience of one man? If that be true which is affirmed by you, that one mans diſobedience cannot be called all mens act, by the ſtrictneſſe and rigour of ſuch a poſition, you will take away the very ground and ſtrength of the Apoſtles argument, and deſtroy the parallel which he doth draw between <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt. The whole
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:168516:59"/>tenor of his diſcourſe is turned upon this hing, as the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one man is the act of all the poſterity that came after him: ſo the obedience of one man is the act of all the poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erity that beleeve in him. And whereas you ſay, <hi>you cannot finde ſuch a paſſage as this parallelled in Scripture;</hi> I would entreat you to conſider the temporal judgments of God as they have been poured upon ſeveral families. The houſe of <hi>Eli</hi> were to ſuffer for many generations, when all that came of that linage did not know what <hi>Eli</hi> did, neither did they give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the ſinnes of <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas;</hi> yet for all this it is clear that the ſinne did redound to the poſterity. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.32.</p>
               <p>Now you come to acquaint us with ſome of your obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and you tell us, <hi>I have heard ſay, and true it is, that what being we had in Adam, we had it aſſoon as himſelf, and ſo, if we had done the ſame actions, he had done nothing before us,</hi> page 131. In this I do agree with you, that it is true that the whole nature of man, as it hath in time ſubſiſted in thouſands and millions, did originally ſubſiſt in <hi>Adam</hi> as in the common root. I do agree alſo that what <hi>Adam</hi> did as the firſt publick man, he did it in our ſtead, yet, if you will go to moments and ſcruples of time, we muſt ſay alſo that in order of exiſtence, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had a being before us; we muſt ſay that <hi>Adams</hi> perſonal ſinne was before the pollution of nature, but our nature is firſt polluted in the corrupted maſſe before we come to commit ſin in perſon, nay before we come perſonally to exiſt.</p>
               <p>You have a ſecond anſwer to the words of the text, you ſay, <hi>If we had all committed that ſinne in Adam, that he was called to account for, then we ſhould have ſinned after the ſame ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude: but we ſinned not after the ſame ſimilitude; and ſo we committed not the ſame ſinne.</hi> And here alſo I yield, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtrictneſſe of termes, that we could not ſiune af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſimilitude of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion: for <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned by a deliberate will and by a free choyce, ſo could not we. Yet nevertheleſſe, though we could not ſinne after the ſame ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, we might ſinne in him as the firſt publick man. For proof of this, read but the words of the text, <hi>Nevertheleſſe death reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Adam to Moſes even ever them that had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſſion,</hi> verſe 14. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:168516:59"/>ſpeaketh of Infants for two thouſand five hundred years, from the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> to the giving of the Law upon Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai.</hi> Here I demand, how could death reign over the Infants aforeſaid? No Law was then publickly given upon Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> and the Infants had no underſtanding, neither could they give any conſent of will: How then could death juſtly reign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, ſeeing they never committed any ſinne in their own perſons? Though they did not, yet they ſinned in the firſt man, and by the reign of death univerſally over all men, over Infants as well as others, the Apoſtle proveth this aſſertion. How weakly then do the Examiners of the late Confeſſion ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, when they ſay, <hi>ſurely, If the Apostle had beleeved any ſuch thing as the reigning of death over all men by the firſt mans ſinne, he would not have omitted that, and onely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned from Adam to Moſes?</hi> page 81. Though he doth mention the reign of death from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes;</hi> this doth not imply any thing to the contrary, but that death hath reigned ever ſince. The words are plain, <hi>death hath paſſed over all men to condemnation.</hi> But there was leſſe reaſon for it, that death ſhould reigne from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the Law was not publickly delivered, eſpecially over Infants, that never ſinned after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion. But ſeeing experience hath plainly ſhewed in this whole interval of time that death hath reigned over Infants; by this <hi>medium</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle proveth them to have been guilty of ſinne. How guilty of ſinne? Not in their own perſons, for they never committed any; but onely in <hi>Adam</hi> the common root of all mankind. And ſo that univerſal affirmation is made good, <hi>by one man ſinne entred into the world and death by ſinne, and death hath paſſed over all men to condemnation.</hi> The univerſality of death doth prove the univerſality of ſinne in the firſt man. But you further ſtand upon a priviledge to interpret the words of the text, <hi>why in ſuch a caſe as this</hi> (ſay you) <hi>may not I have the ſame priviledge to give an expoſition of theſe words (in whom all have ſinned,) ſeeing no ſound Scripture can be given to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the conſcience of any certainty of committing ſinne in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam?</hi> page 133. For that freedome of expounding one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the accounts of another,<note place="margin">☜</note> by my conſent you ſhall have
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:168516:60"/>it; for I think the ſtrongeſt Demonſtration in divine matters is drawn from the harmony of Scripture. And upon theſe grounds we do proceed, becauſe the whole Goſpel in a manner is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the regenerating work of the Spirit. Hence we do ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue that the nature is defiled. And becauſe the promiſe is to beleevers and their ſeed in the laſt diſpenſation, we do hereupon conclude the right to the ſeal: as I have already proved againſt you in <hi>my Treatiſe of Infant Baptiſme.</hi> But ſeeing you are ſo confident in it, that no <hi>ſound Scripture can be given to evince the conſcience of any certainty of our committing ſinne in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi> I pray you deal ingenuouſly, and according to your own principles, do you not beleeve that Infants do bear he puniſhment of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne? How could they juſtly bear the puniſhment, and be no way guilty of the tranſgreſſion? The ſcope of the Apoſtle is plainly to the contrary, becauſe death reigneth over all, over Infants as well as others, from hence he concludeth, that in one all have ſinned. If you do well conſider (by denying original ſinne, and by taking away the corruption of nature as derived from the firſt man.) you do in effect call in queſtion whether there be any regenerating grace to be had from the ſecond man. And ſo when you tell us that no ſound Scripture can be given to prove the certainty of our committing ſinne in <hi>Adam,</hi> you do as good as ſay, no ſound Scripture can be given to evince the certainty of ſatisfaction made to the juſtice of God by the ſuffering of Chriſt. In this matter the Apoſtle ſheweth, that <hi>the firſt man is the figure of him that is to come.</hi> If that be true then which you and the Examiners teach, that the guilt of the firſt mans ſinne doth not redound to his poſterity, you muſt ſay alſo that the obedience of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond man, and the free guilt do not redound to thoſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to him. And this is point blank to go againſt the ſcope of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Now let us hear what your interpretation is, and what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you do give of the Apoſtles meaning. I will repeat your own expreſſions more largely, that the world may both read and give ſentence. Theſe are your words, <hi>I ſhall take ſome pains in opening that place,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>He made him to be ſinne for us, who knew no ſinne. By this meanes we may more
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:168516:60"/>fully underſtand in what ſenſe we were made ſinners in Adam, and knew no ſinne. Wherein it will appear that we were as guiltleſſe of that act, with reference to the fact committed by us, as Chriſt was guiltleſſe in committing the ſinnes of the world. Therefore take notice that Chriſt was ſaid to be made ſinne for us, in no other ſenſe but this, viz. He hath laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him that puniſhment which was due for ſinne; he was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our tranſgreſſions, he was reckoned amongſt tranſgreſſors. But for any man ſo to affirme it, would be as large an untruth as men and Divels could deviſe. For it is one thing to be made ſinne, and another thing to act ſinne. Now Chriſt was ſaid to be made ſinne as one that had taken upon him ſuch loſſes as did accompany ſin. So thoſe dammages that were to befall the world for Adams ſinne, Chriſt is ſaid to bear them, not in their eſſence or being, but in the demerit of them. As he was made ſinne, not knowing a deceiving heart in himſelf, ſo we were made ſinners by Adam, who knew no ſuch ſinne. And many ſuch paſſages you have to the ſame purpoſe,</hi> page. 133, 134. Now I leave it to the Reader to judge to what paſſe you are come. And here ſo farre as you affirme that Chriſt himſelf was free from ſinne when he did bear the penalties of our ſins, we do agree with you. And we further alſo aſſent, that all the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> do bear the puniſhment of his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But whereas you ſay, <hi>that we are onely made ſinne in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam after the ſame manner as Chriſt was made ſinne for us,</hi> I do here admire at your boldneſſe in many reſpects: Firſt, when Chriſt was made ſinne for us, by his own voluntary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking he was made a ſurety and a propitiation for to ſatisfie the juſtice of God for our ſinnes. Will you ſay the like of all the Infants that come of <hi>Adam,</hi> that by the merit of their ſufferings they ſhould propitiate his tranſgreſſion? Secondly, when Chriſt was made ſinne for us he knew no ſinne, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver committed ſinne, he had no natural pollution from the birth. Now it is not ſo with us, we bear the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne as copartners with him in the common pollution of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thirdly, when the Apoſtle ſaith, he made him ſinne for us that knew no ſinne; here you muſt neceſſarily underſtand that he ſpeaks of the peculiar prerogative of the Lord Jeſus
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:168516:61"/>Chriſt, that he did bear the burden of ſinne when he knew no ſinne in himſelf. Now then, if that be true which the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and you do affirme, that Infants are free from the natural pollution, and you here mainly ſtand upon it that they onely bear the burden of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne when they knew no ſuch ſinne; I would entreat you to judge in your own conſcience, whether by ſuch a poſition of the purity of the natural birth you do not make all Infants equal with Chriſt, and if it be true, as you affirme, that they bear the burden of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne when they knew no ſinne, why doth the Apoſtle ſpeak ſo peculiarly, ſo emphatically, ſo ſingularly of Chriſt above all other men, <hi>that he was made ſinne for us when he knew no ſinne?</hi> By this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror you do intrench upon the ſovereign prerogative of the Lord Jeſus, and I fear, (unleſſe you and the Examiners repent) you may one day dearly anſwer for it. But you have an evaſion, for ſay you, <hi>we are as guiltleſſe of that act with reference unto the fact committed by us as Christ was guiltleſſe in committing the ſinnes of the world:</hi> But this reſtriction <hi>(as the act committed by us)</hi> will not mollifie the matter. For though the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> was not committed by any act or will of ours immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our own perſon,<note place="margin">☞</note> yet it was mediatly committed by the free act of our firſt parent. In this caſe, according to Scripture, the will of the firſt man doth paſſe for the will of the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of all that do partake of the nature. And this is the meaning of the Apoſtle, by one man ſinne-entred into the world. By ſinne he meaneth original ſinne, or the ſinne of the nature, and this ſaith he entred into the world; but how? not by the proper private and particular will of every individual man, but by the common parent of all mankind. And for that expreſſion of yours, <hi>that we are as guiltleſſe of Adams ſinne, as Chriſt is guiltleſſe of the ſinnes of the world;</hi> I do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that you did not tremble when you wrote ſuch things as theſe.<note place="margin">☞</note> For we can plainly prove from the ſcope of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that <hi>Adam</hi> by his diſobedience did not only faſten guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his poſterity, but by that act of his he did taint and defile the whole nature of mankind. Will you ſay the like of Chriſt, that he did not onely bear the guilt of the ſinnes of the world, but that his nature was alſo defiled with the luſts of the world. This
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:168516:61"/>were (to uſe your own language) <hi>as large an untruth as men or Devils could deviſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us make enquiry into the true original of your miſtake, you think the words <hi>by the diſobedience of one, many were made ſinners,</hi> Rom. 5. Do allude to that other paſſage, <hi>He made him ſinne for us who knew no ſinne,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. And from the collation of both you conclude, <hi>as Christ was made ſin for us who knew no deceiving heart in himſelf: ſo we were made ſinners by Adam who knew no ſuch ſinne.</hi> But here you are groſſely miſtaken, when you take theſe two for parallel Scriptures which are not parallel. The text in the <hi>Corinthians</hi> is meantionely of the puniſhment of ſinne, that Chriſt did bear the burden of our iniquities. But the text in the <hi>Romans</hi> is not onely meant of the puniſhment and the guilt of ſinne, but alſo of the depravation of the nature of man. The ſcope of the place is plainly to ſhew that by the diſobedience of one, many were conſtituted ſinners or ſinful men. And the word in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal is ordinarily taken for men who have the habit and the nature of ſinne in them. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid <hi>depart from me I am a ſinful man,</hi> Luke 5.8. And our Saviour in another place, <hi>whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me and of my words in this adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous and ſinful generation,</hi> Mark 8.38. And the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, that ſinne by the Commandment might appear exceeding ſinful.</hi> Chap 6. verſe 13. In theſe and ſuch like places the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is taken for ſuch a one as is a ſinner by intrinſecal denomination. And therefore in the preſent caſe when the Apoſtle ſaith by the diſobedience of one many were made <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſinners, as our tranſlation hath it, his meaning is, they were made ſinful men, that is, they had the nature and the habit of ſinne derived to them from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of the firſt man. And thus you may plainly ſee that the two texts which you put for like are very unlike; and this is one chief ground of your error.</p>
               <p>Again, your deductions are every was as unſound, for ſay you, <hi>at Chriſt was made ſinne for us when he knew no ſinne: ſo we are made ſinners for Adam when we knew no ſuch ſinne.</hi> And to confirme this, you further tell us, <hi>it is one thing to be made ſinne ſo as to bear the burden of Adams ſinne, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:168516:62"/>thing to act ſinne.</hi> But whereas you ſpeak of two things onely, you ſhould have mentioned three. It is one thing to be made ſinne, and another thing to be made ſinful, and a third to act ſinne. If you ſpeak of being made ſinne, ſo Chriſt onely was made a ſacrifice for ſinne, to ſatisfie the juſtice of God. But if you ſpeak of being made ſinful, ſo is the whole race of mankind, by the diſobedience of the firſt man. And in the third place, if you ſpeak of committing the act of ſinne, this onely men can do when they have the uſe of reaſon and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. From all which we conclude, though Infants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to act ſinne, yet nevertheleſſe through the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the firſt man they may have the pollution of nature. Further, you ſay, <hi>as we are made ſinners by Adam, ſo we are made righteous by Chriſt, and yet had no hand in thoſe astions that made us righteous; In the like caſe, we were made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by Adams diſobedience, and yet had no hand in his ſo act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> To ſay the truth, if you go to the perſonal act particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and individually, we had no hand either in the obedience of the one, or the diſobedience of the other; yet in a general ſenſe the acts of the two <hi>Adams</hi> are the act of the whole poſterity that come of them. As for example, the firſt man by his diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience did defile the whole nature without the knowledg, wil, motion, or act of any of the perſons that were to come of him; yet ſo really and effectually, that none can come by propagation from him, but they partake of the guilt of his ſinne, and the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of his nature, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.14, 17. So in the like caſe, the ſecond man did ſatisfie the juſtice of God, and ſanctifie our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without any perſonal knowledge, will, motion or act of ours; yet ſo really and effectually, that none of us can truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve but we muſt ſome way come to partake of that nature. <hi>To as many as received him hath he given this power to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſons of God, to them that do beleeve on his name: being born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of man, but of God,</hi> Joh. 1.12, 13.</p>
               <p>Further, you ſay, <hi>we had as little capacity to act in Adam, as we had to act in Chriſt. For this muſt be granted, that when God makes the creature capable to act, he makes him as capable to act for himſelf as for the Devil; Elſe he had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:168516:62"/>provided for his enemies than for himſelf,</hi> page 137. Theſe alſo are the whimſies of the Examiners of the late Confeſſion. For they (ſpeaking of the indifferency of the will) tell us in plain termes, <hi>that as Adams will before his fall did hang in an aequilibrium to good or bad, and enclined more to that which was good than that which was evil: ſo they hold the ſame of the will of all men elſe before their perſonal fall.</hi> To all which I anſwer, that theſe are dangerous ſpeeches, which derogate much from the grace of God in Chriſt. For whoſoever they be that do either leſſen the miſery of nature, and cry up the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ability of the will, they do in ſenſe take that away from Chriſt, which they give to men. As for that objection of yours, that God ſhould better provide for his enemies than for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, hold your ſelf contented, God is able to ſecure his own glory, though all men are born in original ſinne; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth plainly give the reaſon, the Lord doth quicken us when we are dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, when we walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of this world, when we ſerve divers luſts and pleaſures, when we are by nature the children of wrath as well as others. He doth quicken us when we are in this eſtate, that in the ages to come he may ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace towards us in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 1.2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore the declaration of the glory of Chriſt in giving ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life to them that are dead, muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe men to be by nature dead in the paſſes and ſinnes, that they may be the greater objects of mercy. If you go in this method, though all Infants are involved in original ſinne, though all are miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by nature, yet God hath better provided for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf than for his enemies; when his grand deſigne is through the miſerie of man to ſhew the riches of his grace.</p>
               <p>We will now proceed to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. And here let us ſee how many ſhifts you have to elude the force and manifeſt ſenſe of this Scripture. In the beginning you agree that we bear the puniſhment of another mans ſinne. But ſay you, <hi>that children have any ſpawn of ſinne cleaving to them, as ſeed to hatch and gender in, and by any thing received from Adam as we ſprang from his loynes, this I deny,</hi> page 136. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is the judgement of the Examiners in many pages together.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:168516:63"/>Now if this be ſo, that infants have no ſuch ſpawn of original ſinne in them, why do the Scriptures ſpeak ſo largely of the pollution of nature? why is it ſaid of man in general <hi>that the thoughts of the imaginations of his heart are onely evil from his childhood?</hi> Why doth the Lord Chriſt ſo earneſtly preſſe a neceſſity of regeneration? Why doth he urge it upon ſuch a ground as this, <hi>that which is born of the fleſh is fleſh!</hi> There is nothing more clear than that the nature of man is wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed from the very birth. And for the Pſalmiſt in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, though it be true that he did bear the burden of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, yet it is not the whole, nor the full truth. The full truth is this, that he was conceived in ſinne, that in the conception his nature was defiled, and the natural defilement was the cauſe of the two great ſinnes of murther and adultery. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in relation to his natural pollution he doth pray unto the Lord to give him a new heart, he went to the true root and cauſe of all the evil. I muſt needs acknowledge that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the <hi>Examen</hi> when they ſpeak of fallen man, they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der true cauſes of his not willing of good. <hi>Firſt, the ignorance of that which is good; the ſecond, a depraved judgment; the third, a want of due remembrance; the fourth, the power of temptation; the fifth, the habit and cuſtome of ſinne,</hi> page 132. Theſe are indeed true cauſes, but they are too ſhort and too narrow in their determination, they do not come to the root of the evil, to the inherent perverſeneſſe of the will it ſelf, and the pollution of the natural birth. When the bottome of a wound is not ſearched ſuch Mountebanks muſt needs make a palliate cure.</p>
               <p>Next you ſay, <hi>If you will take from Davids particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample the general condition of all infants, why do not you take the text concerning John his being ſanctified from his mothers womb, and argue that all the children of the world are ſanctified in that ſenſe as John was ſanctified? And if this were ſo, there would not be ſo many lazy Prieſts and others in the world as there be,</hi> page 135. For the parallel between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> there is no equality betwixt them in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent collation. For whereas it is ſaid of <hi>John,</hi> that he was ſanctified from his mothers womb, this was by a peculiar privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:168516:63"/>granted to him; And whereas <hi>David</hi> ſaith, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſinne did my mother conceive me, he doth not ſpeak this as a King, or a Saint, or an Iſraelite, but in the moſt general relation as one of the loſt ſonnes of men fallen in <hi>Adam</hi> and born in the corrupted maſſe; and this is the reaſon why from the particular example of <hi>David</hi> we draw a general concluſion of the pollution and the defilement of nature in all. But the Authours of the <hi>Examen</hi> do ſtifly maintain, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conveyed from <hi>Adam</hi> to all his poſterity in the way of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary generation is not defiled with ſinne. For, ſay they, <hi>ſome are ſanctified from the womb, as Jeremiah and John the Baptiſt were, and the Virgin Mary might poſſibly be,</hi> page 65. Though this may be admitted, that ſome of the Saints may be ſanctified ſooner then others, and the work of ſanctification may begin in them from their childhood; yet what is all this to the purpoſe? It muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed that corruption will have a being in certain moments of time before the grace of God can have its being. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was ſanctified from his mothers womb, yet he did curſe the day of his birth, he did reſolve to ſpeak no more to the people in the name of the Lord, he did ſhew many fruits of the fleſh as well as he did manifeſt many fruits of the Spirit. And therefore to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſe, as he did conſiſt of fleſh and ſpirit, in him the fleſh &amp; the Old man had its being before the Spirit and the new man. This I beleeve none can rationally deny, though they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge alſo that he was ſanctified from his mothers womb. But, Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> to return to you again. <hi>For the trouble you have with the lazy Prieſts,</hi> I fear Sir, the more godly, the more conſcientious, the more laborious any Miniſter is, the worſe he is in your opinion, and in the opinion of ſuch as you are: if he oppoſe the innovations and errors of the times. But I pray God give you repentance, elſe you will have an heavy account to make one day for all your hard ſpeeches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the godly Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>For the text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Except ye be converted and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as little children ye cannot enter into the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> Here ſay you, <q>If infants be ſo filthy, why doth our Saviour ſet ſuch a pattern before us? And the Authours of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:168516:64"/>Examen alſo, page 70, ſpeak much to the ſame effect? doth not our Saviour (ſay they) declare the ſtate of children both to be innocent and bleſſed, when firſt he makes it <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> the mark unto which in our converſion and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration we muſt return? And then tells us, that the Kingdome of heaven belongs to ſuch, and is repleniſhed with ſuch?</q> I anſwer, in parables and ſimilitudes we are to look onely to the ſcope. Our Saviour ſpeaketh of the unjuſt Steward of putting the talent to the exchanger, of his own coming like a thief in the night. What then, is it his intent to approve of the evil of theſe wayes? No: he doth onely point to ſomething wherein the force of the ſimilitude doth ſtand? And ſo in the preſent caſe, when he ſpeaketh of humbling our ſelves, and becoming like little children, it is not his purpoſe to aſcribe ſuch perfection to them, as though all infants were free from original ſinne, or that their innocency were the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> the terme to which our converſion and regeneration muſt return. Theſe are very ſtrange deductions. The words of our Saviour are therefore to be taken only in a reſtrained ſenſe, that in affectation of worldly glory we ſhould be like little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. There is no ſuch diſtance between the children of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the children of beggars, but all are one. The mind of the Lord is onely this, that we ſhould come to act the ſame things by the power of grace, as little children do thorough the weakneſſe and infirmity of age. We ſhould not look upon Lords and Ladies, upon learning or parts, or upon any other external excellency in compariſon of the grace of God. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly men that have theſe things are very proud of them, and do look upon them too much; and to theſe the exhortation is given in ſpecial, that they ſhould be humbled, and become as little children. There lyeth then a palpable and groſſe fallacy in your whole diſcourſe, when you take the words abſolutely that all infants are free from ſinne, when our Saviour ſpeaketh in a particular ſenſe only of the act and execution of this or that particular evil.</p>
               <p>Now you proceed, and tell us, <q>it was never heard that children had any ſinne by way of act; and by way of omiſſion, you cannot make it good that they ever received a command
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:168516:64"/>or were capable of any command from God, page 138.</q> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What we have learned we are willing to acknowledge, and though we never heard that infants had any ſinne in them by any act of their own, yet we have learned from Scriptures, yea from the very firſt principles of the faith, that they have it by contagion, and the diſobedience of the firſt man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The words of our Saviour are plain, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh:</hi> And that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>By one man ſinne entred into the world, and death by ſinne.</hi> And many ſuch places there are to prove infants to be guilty of ſinne by the diſobedience of the firſt man, and to be involved in the pollution of nature by hereditary contagion. But becauſe you and the Examiners are ſo ſtrict upon the point, I pray you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve me in this one caſe. When the promiſe was made, <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head,</hi> was not this the promiſe of Chriſt to <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall? If infants therefore are abſolutely acquitted from the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, as being another mans act; if they be free from the pollution of nature, to what end was the promiſe of Chriſt? How did he come in the nature of a Phyſician to cure when there was no diſeaſe? Where there is no malady, there needs no remedy. And whereas you go about to free infants from the ſinne of omiſſion, becauſe they are not capable of a command, I pray you ſhew the reaſon why the Lord was ſo ſtrict in his command to the Jewiſh infant that he ſhould be circumciſed upon the eighth day? <hi>and that the uncircumciſed man-child ſhould be cut off from his people?</hi> Gen. 17.11.12, &amp;c. For my part I know no reaſon of the ſtrictneſſe of this Law, but that the Lord would ſignifie to beleevers under this diſpenſation that there infants were born in original ſinne, and that it was not ſafe to omit the remedy for that diſeaſe. And though in ſtrictneſſe of termes we will yeeld ſo farre to <hi>Corvinus</hi> and to <hi>Julian</hi> the Pelagian, that there is no particular command that forbids an infant to be born in original ſinne; yet for all this they muſt needs allow, that the Law was given to reveal, to convince, and to diſcover the ſinne of the nature, and by the diſcovery thereof to drive a man to Chriſt, to look to him onely for ſanctifying and regenerating glrace, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Law is ſpiritual, and I am carnal, ſold under
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:168516:65"/>ſinne.</hi> And in the ſame text, <hi>I had not known ſinne, except the Law had ſaid, thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> Rom. 7.</p>
               <p>You go on, <q>for this ſinne called original, if infants had committed it, God would have called them to repentance for it, when they had come to years at leaſt wiſe; but I can ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that there is no man living that to this day ever made it appear to be the mind of God for any man to repent of that ſinne.</q> Truly Sir your confidence is very great, and you have more boldneſſe than truth on your ſide. For we may beleeve that you never heard of the promiſes nor the commands mentioned in Scripture when you dare affirme ſuch things as theſe. When the Lord promiſeth in the new Covenant, <hi>I will take out of their bowels a heart of stone, and will give them a heart of fleſh,</hi> Ezek. 36. By the heart of ſtone he means a hard heart, and a ſinful nature that every infant did bring into the world; he doth promiſe to take away the corruption of nature, and that he will ſanctifie his people by his Spirit. So for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, we read every where that men are exhorted to put off the Old <hi>Adam</hi>-like diſpoſition. <hi>That ye put off con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the former converſation the Old man, which is corrupt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deceivable luſts,</hi> Epheſ. 4.22. By the Old man he doth mean the carnal diſpoſition which we have from <hi>Adam</hi> by natural generation. This corrupted diſpoſition of the fleſh he would have the beleeving Epheſians, and in them, all others, to ſubdue and mortifie. And further, if you look to the right uſe of Baptiſme now, as of circumciſion of old, you ſhall finde that the inſtitution of theſe things doth primarily intend the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the ſinne of the nature, as I have already ſhewed in my Treatiſe of Infant Baptiſme. Therefore I cannot but admire at your boldneſſe, when you ſtand ſo much upon it that you can ſafely ſay, <hi>that God never called men to repentance for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal ſinne.</hi> I am ſo farre from your judgment, that I think the greateſt part of repentance lyes in the mortification of the ſinne of the nature. But you have an evaſion, <hi>this ſinne called original ſinne, if infants had committed it, God would have called them to repentance.</hi> Here you put that upon us which we do not ſpeak, and I know no ſolid Writer in the world that doth uſe ſuch an expreſſion of committing original ſinne. It is proper
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:168516:65"/>onely to men of ripe years to commit ſinne. For original ſin, we ſay that is onely by propagation, thorough the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the firſt man, and when men come to be ſanctified by the Spirit of God they are qualified with inward principles to purge out the ſin of the nature.</p>
               <p>Neither doth your argument drawn from the example of Chriſt any whit promote your cauſe. You ſay, <q>If this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple ſhould finde a being in the world, that every infant was born in ſinne, becauſe lineally derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> then where will you get water to waſh your hands of that grand abſurdity, to wit, that Jeſus Chriſt was not free from origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſinne? for then he muſt have a ſhare becauſe he came from the loynes of a woman the Daughter of <hi>Adam,</hi> page 139.</q> To this I anſwer, if you will make Chriſt and all Infants to run parallel in the purity of their natural birth, then why did Chriſt die for them? why did he ſanctifie their nature? There is no need of ſalvation by the merit of Chri,ſt where there is no guilt of ſinne. There needs no ſanctification of the Spirit, where there is no pollution of nature. Why do not you exclude all Infants from theſe as you do from the water of baptiſme? For your Argument drawn from the example of Chriſt. If you build ſo much upon that, I would entreat you to conſider two things; Firſt, why he did aſſume our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Secondly, aſſuming our nature, how came he to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from original ſinne? For the firſt, he did aſſume our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with all the miſeries thereof, ſinne onely excepted, that he might make expiation of ſin in that nature that had ſinned. He did not take the nature of <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall nor that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature which the Saints ſhall have in the ſtate of glory, but meerely the nature of man clothed with all the infirmities thereof, to ſanctifie that nature, and to ſatisfie divine juſtice. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>What the Law could not do in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſent his Son in the ſimilitude of ſinful fleſh and for ſinne condemned ſinne in the fleſh.</hi> In theſe words we may note, that becauſe Chriſt came in the ſimilitude of ſinful fleſh, all fleſh beſides his, of infants as well as others was ſinful fleſh; onely Chriſt came in the ſimilitude of ſinful fleſh. He had the reality of our nature with all the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:168516:66"/>miſeries thereof, onely he was born in the ſimilitude of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, that he might ſatisfie the juſtice of God. And for the ſecond point, how he came to be free from original ſinne, this is plainly expreſſed in the articles of the Creed; <hi>He was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary.</hi> For his conception, that part of the Virgins fleſh was ſo ſanctified, by the overſhadowing of the Holy Spirit, that it might be free from the natural contagion, and that the nature of God and the nature of man together might make one perſon. And that which may further amplifie the truth of this, Chriſt was not born by vertue of that promiſe, <hi>increaſe and multiply;</hi> for this ſince the fall hath filled the world with ſinners: but he was born by vertue of the ſpecial promiſe, <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head.</hi> And this is the true reaſon, for though Chriſt was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> a Daughter of <hi>Adam,</hi> though he had the common nature of all mankind for truth and ſubſtance, yet he was made free from original ſinne by the mean of a wonderful generation. And in this matter by way of retortion we may turn your own weapons upon your ſelf, and upon the Examiners. For if that be true, that all infants are free from natural pollution, what need was there that the Son of God ſhould be conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, and be born of the Virgin <hi>Mary?</hi> His conception needed not to have been by the Holy Ghoſt in caſe the natural generation did not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily inforce the propagation of original ſinne. Theſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means would have been ſuperfluous in caſe he might have been exempt from all ſinne in the ordinary way.</p>
               <p>The arguments which you further alledge are as invalid as the former. You ſay, <hi>If we were in the tranſgreſſion aſſoon as Adam himſelf, how come we to derive it from him?</hi> page 139. To the ſatisfying of this doubt, I would entreat you to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the things that are attributed to <hi>Adam</hi> as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick man, and the things that are aſcribed to him as a particular perſon. If you ſpeak of his publick relations as the root and head of all his poſterity; It is true, what he did, we did in him, we were in the tranſgreſſion aſſoon as himſelf was, his ſin was not ſo much his own as the ſin of the humane nature. But if
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:168516:66"/>you ſpeak of him as a particular perſon, according to the order of exiſtence he is the firſt of the race, and ſo in ſucceſſion of generations all that were in the corrupted maſſe, as they come to be born ſeverally and individually, to derive from him. In a ſenſe therefore it is true that we were in the tranſgreſſion aſſoon as himſelf was. It is the Apoſtles own expreſſion in whom all have ſinned. Yet in flux and ſucceſſion of generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it is as true that he did go before, and all others did follow after in their reſpective times.</p>
               <p>Next you argue, <hi>If we ſinned in him, why might not we have ſinned without him? how came we all to be of one mind?</hi> page 139. You may I confeſſe make ſuch a ſuppoſition, and a thouſand more of the like kind, and there will be no end of your cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. But the Scriptures tell us plainly that one man was made in the beginning, he was the root of all mankind, and by this one man ſinne entred into the world: If this ſeem harſh to you, to the Examiners, and to others, <hi>that all ſhould be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity of ſinning and periſhing by the diſobedience of one man,</hi> this ſhould pacifie your minds, that all are brought under a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſalvation by the obedience of the ſecond man. This is the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles. Take heed then, leſt by diminiſhing the ſinne of the firſt man you do not take away from the grace and the bleſſing brought in by the ſecond. If your nature was never defiled, what need have you of a Chriſt? What need of a new nature? What need of regeneration of the Spirit. I hope the Examiners and you will not ſay that theſe are onely for the purging out of actual ſinne, or the habit of ſin got by imitation. Let us now come to hear your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirations.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I ſtrange (ſay you) at your hard thoughts of <hi>Adam</hi> that he had more proneneſſe to ſinne after the fall than before. If you can bring no proof for what you ſay for this, or for the like caſe, then you muſt excuſe my infidelity in the point.</q> You proceed after that manner as your brethren do, they deſire to have their infidelity excuſed, becauſe they do not read in ſo many letters and ſyllables of the Baptiſme of infants in the new Teſtament. And ſo here, you do not read of ſuch and ſuch particular ſinnes which <hi>Adam</hi> did commit after his fall, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:168516:67"/>therefore you deſire to be excuſed for your unbeleef in that point. But Sir, If you would look to the harmony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you ſhould finde that this teſtimony is not onely given of <hi>Adam,</hi> but alſo of all his poſterity. <hi>God ſaw the wickedneſſe of man that it was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thought of his heart was onely evil from his childhood,</hi> Gen. 6.5. If every imagination of his heart was evil from his childhood, then there muſt be ſome particular time aſſigned where this u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal corruption and depravation of nature did begin. If it did begin at the fall (as there begin it muſt) then you muſt alſo neceſſarily conclude that <hi>Adam</hi> had a greater proneneſſe to ſin after the fall than he had before. But ſay you, <hi>If it could be proved that Adam ſinned ten thouſand times afterward, muſt we therefore ſet all his ſinnes upon the firſt ſinnes ſcore,</hi> page 142? As difficult a point as you make of it, the Apoſtle doth ſet all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſobedience of the firſt man, as he doth put all upon the obedience of the ſecond man. <hi>As by the diſobedience of one, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were made ſinners; ſo by the obedience of one, many were made righteous,</hi> Rom. 5.19. The compariſon would be of no value at all if that which is peculiarly ſpoken to <hi>Adam,</hi> might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to any other parent whatſoever in reſpect of his poſterity. And of the ſinnes which <hi>Adam</hi> did commit, we are not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire why all are ſet upon the ſcore of the firſt ſinne. When he received original righteouſneſſe in the beginning, he received it not onely for himſelf, but alſo for his whole poſterity. And therefore if he had ſtood, he had conveyed it to all his branches; but falling, he loſt it from himſelf and all his off-ſpring. And this is the reaſon why all is charged upon the firſt ſinne, becauſe that was the ſinne of a fiduciary or truſtee. The parent was entruſted with the whole ſtock, which was not only his own peculiar, but alſo the publick loſſe of all his poſterity. If we might ſuppoſe that <hi>Adam</hi> did commit ten thouſand ſinnes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, the hurt could not redound to any other but to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf onely. For how could he bring dammage to ſmall or great by any diſobedient act, ſeeing he was truſted no more? You now come to declare your judgment, <q>why (ſay you) might we not have thought it more ſafe, that that which gave the firſt occaſion to ſinnes being, was yet the original cauſe of all
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:168516:67"/>other ſins committed by him? What need we yet to ſay that ſin had any other father or mother than its firſt parents <hi>viz, the Devil and temptation,</hi> Joh. 8.44.</q> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but in a ſenſe the Devil and temptation may be called the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of ſinne, becauſe wicked men are led by the temptations of Satan, and do imitate his example. But ſtrange it is that you would have no other parents but the Devil and temptation. This is in plain termes to excuſe men, and to make them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame, when any ſinne is committed. The Apoſtle doth otherwiſe ſtate the true cauſe of ſinne, <hi>every man is drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with his own luſt, and enticed, and luſt when it hath conceived, bringeth forth ſinne,</hi> Jam. 1.13. The ſinful will of man and the luſt of his heart, may be a cauſe that doth procreate ſinne as well as the Devil and temptation. And more ſpecially to ſpeak in the caſe we are now upon, concerning the ſinne of the firſt man; and the traducing of original ſinne to all poſterity, I do not doubt but the Devil and temptation had a great ſtroak in the fall of man, but we muſt go to other cauſes as well as to them; <hi>Adams</hi> own defective will was a chief cauſe: And therefore we read of the great judgments that were inflicted upon him for his diſobedience to the command. And for that place of Scripture which you alledge, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. <hi>He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſinne, is of the Devil;</hi> it is moſt true that men commit ſin by the temptation of the Devil, but how doth this prove the point which you undertake, that the Devil is the onely parent of ſinne, and that we need go to no other but to him onely? Beſides, in the caſe of original ſinne, as the corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth paſſe by propagation, the Apoſtle ſaith we muſt go to one man as the fountain; <hi>by one man ſinne entred into the world, and death by ſinne, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore if to ſalve your <hi>Tenet,</hi> you ſhall alledge that ſpeech, <hi>you are of your Father the Devil, &amp; the lusts of your father will you do:</hi> By this I do confeſſe that the Devil is proved the firſt parent of ſinne by infuſion and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion; but he is not the father by generation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>put off, as concerning the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, the Old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful luſts:</hi> Epheſ. 4.22. Here, by the Old man we are to underſtand the Old <hi>Adam</hi> like diſpoſition, as it hath paſſed from <hi>Adam</hi> to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:168516:68"/>all his poſterity. This old diſpoſition the Saints are to put off, and they are to endeavour to put on the Chriſt-like nature. So then, if you will ſay that the Devil was the firſt father of ſinne by temptation and ſeduction, we will not gain-ſay it. Onely we do intreat you to remember that <hi>Adam</hi> is the cauſe of the conveying of original ſinne to all his poſterity by genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and traduction.</p>
               <p>You have yet more evaſions if it might be poſſible to illude the truth. <q>If <hi>Adam</hi> (ſay you) had ſinned afterwards, how can we ſay that he had a way to communicate it to all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity? It is more then the Devil can do to infuſe ſinne into any man without a mans conſent, page 142.</q> This is true if you ſpeak in the caſe of actual ſinne onely, but for the deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of original ſinne, the caſe is otherwiſe. The corruption of nature is derived from the diſobedience of the firſt man. His perſonal diſobedience was ſufficient to deprave and vitiate the whole nature.<note place="margin">☞</note> This may be proved by the harmony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and there is no harſhneſſe in the point ſo long as there is ſuch an effectual remedy prepared by the ſecond man for the loſt ſonnes of men. And yet further, though the firſt man by his fall did vitiate the nature without any individual or perſonal conſent of ours, yet the lying and living in the ſinfulneſſe of nature is not without our deliberate and free conſent. <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſſe more than light,</hi> Joh. 3.18, 19, 20. God doth at ſundry ſeaſons open the eyes of men that they may ſee their natural pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; but they have not a deſire to ſee that which they may ſee. Further, <q>you adde, ſome ſay the want of pure nature is the cauſe of our ſinne, but it is plain that the purity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture exempts not a man from ſinne, for if it had, then <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, page 142.</q> We would not have you to miſtake our meaning, we do not ſtand ſo much upon the want of the purity of nature, as upon the pollution and depravation of nature. And this ſince the fall is no onely the cauſe of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but alſo is the true cauſe why we can do nothing elſe but ſinne. And this begins to appear to thoſe who are ſanctified by the Spirit, and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>in me, that is, in my fleſh, dwelleth no good thing.</hi> For other kind of men they do not
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:168516:68"/>feel the burden of a carnal mind. As a bucket of water weighs nothing in the Well, but when it is removed from its proper element, then the weight thereof is diſcerned. Pride of heart, and other ſecret luſts, are not burdenſome to a carnal man who is in his proper element, but a ſpiritual man feels the enmity of theſe againſt the command of God, and ſees by experience that according to the fleſh he can do nothing elſe but ſin. Further, you alledg, <hi>that it is like that Adam would not have ſinned again becauſe he ſped ſo ill,</hi> page 142. I beleeve it was with him after his fall as it was with <hi>David</hi> after his two ſinnes of murder and adultery; <hi>David</hi> when he had committed thoſe ſinnes did look to the fountain of his miſery as it did lye in the pollution of the natural birth, <hi>I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſinne did my mother conceive me.</hi> Hereupon he did pray unto the Lord that he would create in him a new heart. Even ſo, <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall was able to ſee his miſerie when his eyes were opened; but he was not, as you ſuggeſt, like a burned child, able of himſelf to take heed of the fire. All the ability that he had, was by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the promiſe, and the ſame ability we now have to help us out of our natural corruption. Our Saviour told the Jewes, <hi>if the Sonne will make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed,</hi> Joh. 8.36. By freedome we are to underſtand not ſuch a civil immunity as Emperors and Kings do give, but a freedome from the bondage and vaſſalage of corruption. And therefore when the Jewes made him this anſwer, that they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, and never in bondage to any man, his reply was, <hi>he that committeth ſin, is the ſervant of ſin,</hi> v. 33, 34. The ſlavery of ſin is the bondage that is here meant, and there is no other way to be freed but by Chriſt onely. <hi>Further,</hi> you ſay, <hi>we cannot prove that Adam did ſubject himſelf to any temptation after the fall,</hi> pag. 143. What if we do not read in ſo many letters and ſyllables that he did ſubject himſelf to temptation? can you therefore probably col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that he was free from all ſinne, and that he did reſiſt all temptations? Again, ſuppoſe that after his fall he did reſiſt many temptations, yet as the ſtrongeſt Chriſtian may fall when God doth leave him, and the weakeſt may ſtand when the Lord will uphold him with his ſupporting grace; Even ſo, <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without all original ſinne, being left to himſelf to try what
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:168516:69"/>free-will could do, might fall in a ſtate of natural purity. And being ſupported by the Spirit, to ſhew what grace could do, might be able to ſtand in a ſtate of natural corruption. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that you have ſaid doth not any way inforce an equality of the ſtates, or that a mans ability was as great after as it was before the fall.</p>
               <p>Now let us go to the third Scripture, <hi>and were by nature the children of wrath as well as others,</hi> Epheſ. 2 3. Here, to ſupport the purity of nature and to avoid the force of this text, you have many evaſions and ſhifts; let us hear them as they come in their order. <q>There are (ſay you) natural men that diſcern not the things of God, neither can do; for a man cannot go Eaſt and Weſt at one and the ſame time, neither ſerve two Maſters to be true to them both, page 145.</q> I confeſſe it is true that a man cannot go Eaſt and Weſt at one and the ſame time, but <hi>our question is,</hi> whether any natural man, meerely as natural, without the inſpiration of the Spirit can go any other way but that which is meerely enmity againſt God? The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the natural man perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are fooliſhneſſe to him, neither can he perceive them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſpiritually to be diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. He ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this of the Philoſophers and other Grecians who had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved nature to the higheſt: To theſe the preaching of the Croſſe was fooliſhneſſe. They could diſcern the wiſedome of <hi>Plato,</hi> and the depth of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> but the wiſedome of Chriſt they were not able to diſcern. Hereupon in the three firſt Chapters of the Epiſtle the Apoſtle doth largely diſpute that the knowledge of theſe things doth meerely come by the inward teaching and revelation of the Spirit. And then he ſhutteth up the diſpute with this <hi>coronis, If any man ſeem to be wiſe in this world, let him become a fool that he may be wiſe.</hi> A fool is one that hath no wit, he is not able to ſpeak for himſelf, or to help himſelf. The way then to know Chriſt is not by the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of natural abilities, but rather by the true ſight of inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the loſt condition we are fallen into, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was a Philoſopher of great name amongſt the Grecians, yet of all the books that he wrote, of all the ſpeeches that he ſpake in none of them all he came nearer to God than in that ſpeech which he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:168516:69"/>is reported for to ſpeak, <hi>O ens entium miſerere mei,</hi> O thou being of beings, have mercy upon me. The firſt ſtep to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth beginne with the ſight of miſery, and the next is to looke after the free grace and mercie of God.</p>
               <p>But you go on, and tell us, <hi>nature, ſimply ſo conſidered as it is created of God, cannot oppoſe any ſpiritual light, but comply with thoſe things which God holds forth unto it,</hi> page 146. Here we deſire you to keep to the ſtate of the queſtion, we are not upon the debate of nature in its purity, but of nature as it is ſince the fall. If you ſpeak of nature created in the beginning, nature is good; nature cannot oppoſe any ſpiritual light, and it is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to thoſe ends for which God made it. But as ſtrictly as both you and the Examiners ſtand for ſuch a natural purity, I would entreat you to ſhew the man in all <hi>Aſia, Africa, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> or <hi>America</hi> that hath this purity, this integrity of nature. But if you ſpeak of nature vitiated and corrupted, the Scriptures do every where make mention of ſuch a nature that it is enmity againſt God, that it is not ſubject to the Law of God, nor can be. And therefore when the Examiners in the Chapter of free wil do plead ſo ſtrongly that there are ſome good things in natural men, as in <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Balaam,</hi> and that all natural men are not equally corrupt; what of all this? this doth not prove the goodneſſe of nature. For that ſome natural men have ſome inward workings in them, it is from the convictions of the Spirit, and that ſome are leſſe evil then others; it is from the bar of reſtraining grace. Otherwiſe, take a natural man as meerly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, <hi>he is not ſubject to the Law of God, nor can be,</hi> Rom. 8.7. As it may be ſeen in this familiar inſtance. When men are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the State, and will not have them to reign over them, all the money, horſes, armour, Cities, Caſtles that they can get into their power, are employed to ſet up another Law, and to ſupplant the power that is over them. So all the endeavours of a natural man, all his principles and his reaſonings are to pluck down Chriſt, and to ſet up his own excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And therefore the natural mind is enmity againſt God.</p>
               <p>Next you cite two Scriptures concerning ſins againſt nature
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:168516:70"/>
                  <hi>Backbiters, haters of God, deſpitefull, proud, boaſters, inventors of evil things, diſobedient to parents, without understanding, Covenant-breakers, without natural affection,</hi> Rom. 1.30, 31. 2 Tim. 3.3. From hence you draw this concluſion, <q>to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural (ſay you) were to have acted ſuch actions as might have teſtified to the world that they had been lovers of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe actions were wanting, they are ſaid to be unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. So it may appear that nature was not improved to thoſe ends to which God aſſigned it, page 146.</q> It is true that in theſe Scriptures the word nature is taken in the better ſenſe, yet not in ſuch a ſenſe as will furniſh your intention. Firſt, I do acknowledge that God hath left reliques or remaind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his Law in the hearts of the Gentiles. This is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the Law of nature, and by this men know that God ought to be worſhipped, that parents ought to be honoured, and that every man is to have his own, &amp;c. Secondly, I yield alſo that they who go againſt this Law may rightly be called unnatural, becauſe they go againſt the dictates or principles of of nature. Thirdly, they who do thus deviate from natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples do not improve nature to thoſe ends which God hath made it. All theſe things I do allow, &amp; ſo far I wil go along with you; But how do you prove from hence the purity of nature, and that a meer natural man, as ſuch, is able to underſtand the things of the Spirit of God? You do in the next page diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh natural men into two kinds, theſe are your words. <q>Who requireth no other way to be glorified but by thoſe principles that he had furniſhed them withal. And becauſe they oppoſed their own nature, reſuſing the counſel of God, they are called unnatural, becauſe they imployed their nature wholly to ſatisfie their luſts. Such natural men percieve not the things of God.</q> The ſame matter in ſubſtance is ſpoken by the Examiners in the Chapter of free will, for the Synod ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rightly determined according to the Scriptures that <hi>a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man being altogether averſe from that good, and dead in ſinne, he is not able by his own ſtrength to convert himſelf or prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thereunto.</hi> Againſt this paſſage the men take great offence, and, as their manner is, accuſe the Synod for their defects and falſhoods. For their defects, they blame them becauſe they
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:168516:70"/>do not diſtinguiſh the ſeveral kinds of natural men; and for their falſhoods they accuſe them for ſaying that the fallen man hath loſt all ability to ſpiritual good. They diſtinguiſh alſo ſeveral kinds of will, and tell us in the third place, <hi>as the will of our first parents, ſo of all men elſe doth stand in a kind of aequilibrium</hi> pag. 128.129, 130.</p>
               <p>Now to take off theſe ſeveral Objections, I would entreat both you and them to conſider theſe two points. Firſt, if you look to the better ſort of natural men, to thoſe who are no Backbiters, no Covenant-breakers, &amp;c. Whether may not many of theſe in the moſt eſſential, vital and ſpiritual parts of the Law, be great enemies againſt God, and be lovers of themſelves more than lovers of God? If the moſt refined natural men may be ſecret enemies, why do you and they ſpeak of pure nature, and of the improvement of natural abilities when it is certain that men can do no good without the help of the Spirit? Natural men may be diſtinguiſhed into a thouſand kinds according to the different circumſtances of time and place, yet all of them do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this, that they are natural, and without the help of the Spirit they are not able to judge of the things of God. Secondly, when the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the Gentiles, <hi>who having no Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law, their thoughts in the mean while accuſing or elſe excuſing one another,</hi> Romans 2.14. When the Gentiles do make uſe of the Law written in their heart (as they do at certain ſeaſons) to judge themſelves, doth not this proceed from the general convictions and workings of the Spirit? If the act of ſelf-judging be from the conviction of the Spirit, this is no praiſe to natural abilities, but the glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the grace of God. And the words of the Confeſſion are very ſound, <hi>that a natural man cannot convert himſelf, or prepare himſelf thereunto.</hi> In which words they do diſtinguiſh between converſion it ſelf, and the antecedaneous works before converſion. In neither of theſe they ſay that a natural man is able to do any thing of himſelf, but all his ability is from the help of the Spirit. I wonder then what reaſon the Examiners had given them to cavil at ſuch an innocent expreſſion. But if you ſhall ſtand upon the letter of the text, <hi>that the Gentiles do by nature the things contained in the Law.</hi> Here you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:168516:71"/>that the Apoſtle doth onely oppoſe the natural Law to the Law written in tables of ſtone and communicated to the Church by revelation. He never meant that any of the Gentiles meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their own ſtrength were able to keep that Law which was made known to them. Only at ſeaſons the Spirit did excite and ſtirre up ſtrong convictions in their conſciences, to apply thoſe principles and dictates which they had by the light of nature. The moſt common and univerſal maxime of all men in the world, is this, <hi>that there is a God:</hi> Why then doth the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Godhead ſo forcibly and powerfully awake at ſome intervals of time more than at others? We can give no other reaſon but this, that the truth in the hearts of the Gentiles is like a cinder in the Smiths forge, which by the operations and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the Spirit is enlivened, and being once enlivened, men have more power to judge themſelves, and to look after God in thoſe ſeaſons than at others.</p>
               <p>And from hence alſo we might take occaſion to anſwer that great difficulty in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Apoſtle in the firſt Chapter ſpeaking of the knowledge of the Gentiles, and how naturally they hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe, and that for this cauſe the Lord doth give them up to a reprobate ſenſe; yet in the next Chapter he doth ſhew that the Gentiles do by nature the things contained in the Law, and do ſhew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the work of the Law written in their hearts when their thoughts do at ſundry times accuſe or excuſe one another. To the reſolution of the difficulty we ſay, that the Gentiles ſo farre forth as they are principled by the corruption of nature are prone to no other but to impriſon the light; but as they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and do ſubmit unto the convictions of the Spirit, they are helped ſometimes to go ſo farre as to judge themſelves, and to cry out in their miſery, <hi>O being of beings, have mercy upon us.</hi> The main drift of the Apoſtle, is to ſhew that Jewes and Gentiles are both under ſinne, and how by the ſight of the miſery of nature ſuch of them as are ſaved come to be ſaved onely by looking after the grace and the free-mercy of God. If this be the meaning of the Spirit what ſhall we think of pure nature, or the emproving of nature to thoſe ends to which God had aſſigned it? Theſe are the Chimera's and fictions of mens own
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:168516:71"/>deviſing. For if we will go to the utmoſt that a natural man can do, at ſeaſons he hath ability to judge himſelf, this is not from himſelf, but from the convictions of the Spirit. And it is never better with him in the way to attain ſalvation than when he is beaten off from all his own abilities; when in the ſight of his own miſery and emptineſſe he doth rely upon the mercy of God.</p>
               <p>Now we will go on to the meaning of that expreſſion, and <hi>were by nature the children of wrath as well as others.</hi> Here you diſtinguiſh betwixt that wrath which is due by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, and the wrath which is due for deſpiſing the riches of grace. <q>Concerning this text (ſay you) we were by nature the children of wrath as well as others; if it be univerſal, it muſt be meant of the firſt condemnation which came by <hi>Adam.</hi> But if it be meant of the ſecond wrath, then it belongs to ſuch perſons onely as are dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes; that is, ſuch as have been in actual defiance, which walked after the courſe of the world, after the Prince of the power of the aire in oppoſition to the Spirit of truth, page 150.</q> Here I do agree with you, that diſtinction is to be made between the wrath due for the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the wrath due for the actual refuſal of Chriſt in the tender of grace. Though this diſtinction be admitted, yet it doth not diſanul that truth <hi>we were by nature the children of wrath as well as others.</hi> For infants, ſo farre forth as they come out of <hi>Adams</hi> loynes in that preciſe and ſingle conſideration they may be the children of wrath by nature, though the cauſe why wrath doth not ſeize upon them, is from the ſhedding of the blood of Chriſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, let us take this expreſſion, and <hi>were by nature the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath as well as others,</hi> that it is meant onely of thoſe who have been in actual defiance, this will avail nothing ſo long as it is clear from the text that men by nature can do no other than live in actual defiance againſt God. Neither do the Examiners mend the matter by their Intepretation, when they ſay, <q>it is one thing to be ſinners from our firſt nativity, and another in time to become the children of wrath by our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal fall and actual diſobedience, which alſo coming to paſs in our natural man, and by his default we may truly be ſaid
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:168516:72"/>to be by nature the children of wrath, eſpecially when ſinne by cuſtome becomes a ſecond nature to us, page 78.</q> Here we will be no adverſaries to them ſo farre as they ſay that men become the children of wrath by their own perſonal falls and actual diſobedience. But the queſtion is, whether this diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience doth not radically and originally proceed from the default of the nature. They ſeem to ſay ſo much in ſenſe when they do oppoſe it. Secondly, though it be true which they ſay, that the evil doth come upon men throught heir perſonal fall, yet the Apoſtle doth eſpecially look unto the ſinne of the nature: And therefore doth amplifie the grace of God in quickning and enlivening again when he ſaith <hi>you hath he quickned that were dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes.</hi> They were not onely truly dead in ſinne thorough cuſtome and ſinful converſation, but alſo thorough the ſtate and condition of their natural birth, they were by nature the children of wrath as well as others. Upon theſe grounds he tells them that God who was rich in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy did quicken them, <hi>when they were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, you come to open the meaning of the expreſſion, dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes. You ſay, <q>a ſpiritual death muſt be meant of a declining from ſpiritual things, which is a reſiſtance of the ſpirit, or a dying, that is a forſaking the truth of God made manifeſt in them. Now ſuch a death as this cannot befall any who never had that ſpiritual life; for it is the loſſe of life that muſt prove a death, or otherwiſe we may ſay that all other creatures beſides man are ſpiritually dead, page 151.</q> In this point you and I do agree that the loſſe of life muſt prove a death; and this to me is the great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why not only the Epheſians, but alſo all mankind had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpiritual life before they became to be dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes. It is plaine from the ſcope of Scripture and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy of faith, as I have proved before, that this death came in by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> therefore he had ſpiritual life before his fall. And for that expreſſion of yours, <hi>otherwiſe we may ſay as well that all other creatures are ſpiritually dead;</hi> I anſwer, not ſo neither: other creatures can not properly be ſaid to be ſpiritually dead becauſe they never had a capacity of ſpiritual life. And
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:168516:72"/>though men are dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, they are not dead as ſtocks and ſtones and other ſenceleſſe creatures, but they are dead as they who ſometime had ſpiritual life, and may have the return of the ſame life again in and <hi>thorough Chriſt the way, the truth, and the life.</hi> So alſo the Examiners in the Chapter of free will, page 130. do but calumniate, when they ſay that we teach, <hi>that a man is a meere paſſive block or a dead trunck with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a willing or a nilling faculty.</hi> This is an odious imputation of their own deviſing; we hold that man is a rational creature, and he hath thoſe natural and eſſential properties of the ſoul, though in ſpiritual things he be altogether dead. And for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things alſo he may be ſaid to have a remote capacity when blindneſſe ſhall be taken away from his underſtanding, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe from his will. It is an excellent ſpeech of <hi>Auguſtine, poſſe credere naturae eſt hominum,</hi> to have a remote ability to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, is of the nature of men, for ſtocks and ſtones have no ſuch capacity. And in oppoſition to natural men, he ſaith, <hi>velle credere gratiae eſt fidelium,</hi> to have a will to beleeve, is of the grace given to beleevers: ſhewing that no natural man hath an immediate power to beleeve till he come inwardly to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Let us hear then what you can ſay; how the ſonnes of men may be ſaid to be dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes. <q>If you ſhall mean that every man, or all mankind in that ſenſe is dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the light or the life of the Goſpel is made known to them, then I ſhall grant it. But I ſhall deny that ſuch a death is any ſinne: For, where no Law is made manifeſt, there is no tranſgreſſion. But all children, if you mean infants, have no Law, or Law made known, page 152.</q> This is true in the caſe of actual ſinne, that there muſt be a Law, and a Law made known, or elſe there can be no actual tranſgreſſion. And for this reaſon we ſay that all Infants are exempt from the guilt of actual ſinne, becauſe they are not capable of the knowledge of a Law. But this is not our queſtion, the point in hand is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the guilt of original ſinne. Suppoſe there were no Law given perſonally and individually to infants, yet the Law once given to <hi>Adam,</hi> is ſufficient to involve all his children in the ſin of the nature till they come to be freed by Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:168516:73"/>in ſenſe we affirme that not onely the Epheſians, but alſo all others are dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes. But let us further enquire into the meaning of the words, <hi>and were by nature the children of wrath as well as others.</hi> Doth not the Apoſtle go here to the corruption of nature as to the Fountain? and whereas you ſay, <hi>that the Epheſians by the courſe of their lives living in rebellion againſt God, were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the children of wrath;</hi> Do not you by this affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation yield the cauſe? For admit that the Epheſians did by their own free act live in diſobedience againſt God, yet all comes to one iſſue, when they did it by a natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion received from <hi>Adam,</hi> the common root of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature. But you further ſay, <q>It cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that thoſe who never committed any actions of diſobedience ſhould have this text applied to them; but infants neither did nor could commit any acts of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; Therefore this will not prove that infants were ſo the children of wrath by nature, page 152.</q> This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that infants were not ſo the children of wrath by nature, is, as Logicians call it, an ignorance of the <hi>elench.</hi> For we do not ſay that Infants in every reſpect are ſo the children of wrath as thoſe Epheſians who lived in wilful diſobedience. It is enough for us to affirme that they are any way the children of wrath, ſo farre at leaſt as they do partake of the corruption of the nature. For the clearing of the point, let us diſtinguiſh three ſorts of men that are lyable to wrath.</p>
               <p>The firſt are ſuch as reject Chriſt in the publick tenders of the Goſpel. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto them, they ſhould have had no ſinne, but now they have no cloak for their ſinne,</hi> Joh. 12.48. In this ſenſe we ſay that not onely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, but alſo the natural Epheſians themſelves were free from the guilt of ſinne. For if infants (as you affirme) cannot ſinne, nor men neither, if they can truly maintain that they rceived no Law; In this ſenſe the Epheſians themſelves, who ſerved divers luſts and pleaſures could not ſinne, becauſe the Goſpel was not preached, and Chriſt was not tendered to them. The Apoſtle ſaith they were at
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:168516:73"/>that time ſtrangers from the Common-Wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>aliens</hi> from the Covenant of promiſe. Secondly, they are lyable to wrath, who, though they never had the Goſpel preached, yet do wilfully hold the truth in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19.20, 21. In this ſenſe the Epheſians before their converſion did ſerve divers luſts, and were by nature the children of wrath as well as others. The ſinnes of their lives, though they were their own voluntary acts, yet they were the proper and genuine fruit of their ſinful and depraved nature. In this as in the former ſenſe, I do willingly yield, that infants cannot ſinne as thoſe that diſobey the Goſpel, becauſe they have no diſcoveries of Chriſt in the publick Miniſtry of the Word. Neither can they ſinne as did the Gentiles, which went againſt the general convictions of the Godhead in the conſcience, and wilfully held the truth in unrighteouſneſſe. Thirdly, they are lyable to wrath, who, though they never committed actual ſinne, yet do partake of the ſinne of the nature, and of the guilt of that ſinne. If this be not ſo, what is the meaning of the words, <hi>and were by nature the children of wrath as well as others?</hi> In a ſenſe then it is true, that ſo farre as men are by nature, ſo far they are the children of wrath.</p>
               <p>Here then two objections come to be anſwered, the one in reſpect of infants, the other in reſpect of them who live out of the bounds of the viſible Church. Firſt, in the caſe of infants, ſome may ſay, they muſt unavoidably lie under wrath, if this once be admitted, that by nature they are the children of wrath. I anſwer, the conſequences is not good, for though by nature they are lyable to wrath, yet they do not unavoidably lie under a neceſſity of periſhing. As for example, <hi>David</hi> by his murther and adultery, <hi>Peter</hi> by the denial of his Maſter, and <hi>Paul</hi> by perſecuting of the Church, did fall under wrath, yet wrath did not ſeize upon them. So infants, though by nature they are the children of wrath, yet that wrath due unto the ſinne of the nature doth not lay hold upon them becauſe Chriſt hath ſatisfied the juſtice of God.</p>

               <p>Secondly, if it be further alledged, that they which live out of the boſome of the viſible Church muſt lie under a neceſſity of periſhing, not onely becauſe by nature they are the children of wrath, but becauſe they want the Goſpel; the means of their ſalvation. Here I anſwer, though they want the moſt effectual outward means, yet they do not ſimply want all the means. Nay, I may affirme there is no man whoſe eyes are truly opened thorough the conviction of the Spirit to ſee his loſt condition who is under an abſolute neceſſity of periſhing. For God who is a God of grace and mercy, is ready to help them that come to him in a ſenſe of their miſery. We have a proof for this in the words of <hi>Hanain</hi> the Prophet, to <hi>Aſah</hi> the King, the <hi>eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole earth to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalf of them whoſe heart is perfect towards him,</hi> 1 Chr. 16.9.</p>
               <p>He doth not ſpeak in the caſe of <hi>Aſah,</hi> or of the family of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> alone; but the words are more general; the eyes of the Lord go thorough the whole earth, to help all thoſe whoſoever they be, that have perfect hearts toward him. From whence I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that men are not left under an unavoidable neceſſity of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing.</p>
               <p>Thus I have gone thorough all the arguments, brought by Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> to prove the purity of the natural birth; and where the Examiners have pitched upon the ſame reaſons, I have taken them in for company.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Chapter concerning Original ſinne they do firſt endeavour to bring ſuch Scriptures as ſeem to make for their own purpoſe. And here they pitch upon that image of God, that man is ſaid to retain ſince his fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. Our anſwer is, though men may be ſaid to have that image, and may carry the reſemblance thereof, yet this doth not diſprove their being born in original ſinne. Notwithſtanding ſuch a polluted birth they may have the remainders of that image which was by creation, and a poſſibility of the recovery of the ſame image by Chriſt. That this truth may more clearly appear, we will diſtinguiſh betwixt the image of God which is external, and the image which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. For the image that is external and ſtands in Lordſhip and dominion over the creature, man hath not this image by natural generation, but by covenant promiſe, and the Mediators blood. And therefore we read, that the Lord after the flood did revive the great Charter once given to man before the fall. <hi>Be fruitful and repleniſh the earth, and the fear of you, and the dread of you ſhall be upon every fowle of the aire, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fiſhes of the Sea: into your hand are they delivered,</hi> Gen. 9.2. The ſame priviledge is here granted to <hi>Noah</hi> and his ſons, which was given to <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:168516:76"/>But how did <hi>Noah,</hi> his ſonnes, and in them all mankind come to partake of it? Not by generation, but by the promiſe and Covenant. In the former Chapter we read that <hi>Noah</hi> offered up a Sacrifice, and the Lord ſmelt a ſavour of reſt in and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Mediators blood. Hereupon he made a ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that he would no more curſe the ground for mans ſake, though the thoughts of the imaginations of his heart were evil from his childhood. By vertue of the promiſe doth man come to be re-inveſted with that part of the Image of God which ſtands in Lordſhip over the creature, and he hath not this priviledge in reſpect of his natural birth. Secondly, if we look to that part of the Image of God which is internal in the ſoule, in this ſenſe, though man be born in original ſinne, and though he hath loſt the ſpiritual knowledge, righteouſneſſe and holineſſe wherein he was moſt like his Creator and doth now carry the image of Satan, yet nevertheleſſe he hath ſtill ſome remainders and reliques of the former Image, he hath an immortal ſoul, an underſtanding, will and other natural powers, and in and thorough Chriſt he hath a capacity to receive that ſpiritual part of the Image of God which was loſt. According to the tenor of this doctrine we may expound the precept that doth inhibit the ſhedding of mans blood, <hi>whoſo ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed, for in the Image of God made he man.</hi> The ſame anſwer may be given to that text which they alledge in the twelfth and laſt place, <hi>therewith curſe we men, which are made after the ſimilitude of God,</hi> Jam. 3 9. Here we ſay the ſame in ſubſtance, that though men are born in original ſinne, yet they have ſome reliques and remainders of the former Image that was loſt, and a poſſibility by Chriſt to come to the fulneſs of that glory.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Scripture to be conſidered, is that place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.4, 5. Where, ſay they, <q>we have two argnments more to prove <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and conſequently all men to be ſtill crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted innocent. The firſt is from the perfection of all Gods works, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. He is the rock, his work is perfect; for all his wayes are judgment, a God of truth and without iniquity, juſt and right is he. How then can he, who is holy, righteous, and pure, create any thing that is unrighteous, unclean or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure?
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:168516:76"/>The ſecond is taken from Gods complaint there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mens perſonal fall and corrupting themſelves, whom God had not brought forth with any ſuch ſpots, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. They have corrupted themſelves, their ſpot is not the ſpot of his children, they are a perverſe and crooked generation, <hi>page</hi> 67.</q> But neither of theſe two arguments will prove the purity and the innocency of mans natural birth. For though all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants through the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> are born in original ſinne, this is no impeachment to God, he both is, and ever was righteous in all his works. Though all mankind hath fallen through the diſobedience of the firſt man, yet he was pure, righteous, and holy in the work of creation. And though the greater part of the Iſraelites did rebell in the Wilderneſſe, this did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the goodneſſe of God to that people in bringing them out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Secondly, whereas it is ſaid that they did cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt themſelves by their own perſonal diſobedience, this muſt needs be ſo, becauſe they were a rebellious generation. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh remarkably to this purpoſe in the latter end of the former Chapter. <hi>I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt your ſelves, and turn aſide from the way which I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you,</hi> ver. 29. <hi>When he ſaith I know that ye will utterly corrupt your ſelves;</hi> ſhall we argue from hence that they were free from all corruption for the preſent, and that the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of themſelves ſhould meerely be their own perſonal act for the future? This cannot be the force of the argument. For <hi>Moſes</hi> did conclude that they would ſhew the fruits of their corruption after his death, becauſe he did perceive ſuch a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and corrupted nature in them for the preſent. <hi>Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord: How much more after my death?</hi> And for that expreſſion, <hi>their ſpot, is not the ſpot of his children,</hi> it is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Gods children have many ſtaines and ſpots, as <hi>Noah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Peter:</hi> But becauſe they have a living fountain of grace within, they do daily purge out the ſinne and corruption of nature, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Now it is not ſo with others, or with thoſe Apoſtates, to whom <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake, becauſe they had no living principle within; they would totally fall from that good which they ſeemed to have. This is the ſence of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:168516:77"/>the text, and how doth this prove the purity of the natural birth?</p>
               <p>A third place they bring to aſſert the innocency of man, is the eighth Pſalm, where <hi>ver.</hi> 4.5, 6. the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks thus of all mankind, <q>what is man that thou art mindful of him, and the ſonne of man that thou viſiteſt him? for thou haſt made him a little lower than the Angels, and haſt crowned him with glory and honour. Say they, the Pſalmiſt ſhewes that man is ſtill ſet in honour by his firſt ſtate of production, though he doth not long retain the ſame, but falls therefrom. But if a man had been created ſo corrupt as you ſpeak, he had not onely been lower than the Angels, but below all ereatures here, <hi>page</hi> 67.</q> For the general ſence of this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, we do agree that man hath ſtill dominion, Lordſhip, &amp; preheminence over the creature, &amp; in this dignity &amp; honour, he doth carry the lively effigies, reſemblance and Image of God, as he is his vicegerent upon the earth. There is none who doubts of the truth of this in general, but the main queſtion is about the ground of the vicegerency, whether it be from the ſtate of man in his natural production, as theſe Cenſors do affirme. This we deny, for according to the courſe of natural generation, as it is ſince the fall, manhath loſt the image of God in dominion and Lordſhip over the creature; the earth is accurſed, &amp; the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made ſubject to vanity. You will ſay how then doth he enjoy this priviledge ſtill? I anſwer, by Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore it is obſervable that the Apoſtle doth apply the paſſages of the Pſalmiſt more immediately to Chriſt, <hi>thou madest him a little lower than the Angels, thou crowneſt him with glory and honour; and diddeſt ſet him over the work of thy hands, thou haſt put all things in ſubjection under his feet,</hi> Heb. 2.7, 8 9. The whole creation then immediately is put under Chriſt, and in and thorough him all men now come to have dominion and Lordſhip over the creature. And therefore though all are fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> and have loſt this priviledge in their natural birth, yet it is repaired and renewed by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>A fourth place which they bring to evict mans uprightneſſe by the creation, is that of the wiſe man, <hi>God hath made man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:168516:77"/>but they have ſought out many inventions,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.29. Here they inſiſt eſpecially upon two particulars. Firſt, that this is ſpoken of all mankind. Secondly, that every mans fall is by his own perſonal and individual act. Theſe are their words, <hi>he aſcribes it not to their firſt fathers alone, but to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals of their posterity likewiſe, ſaying, but they have ſought cut many inventions,</hi> page 68. Neither do we affirme, that the blame is onely to be laid on <hi>Adam,</hi> for others alſo, born in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal ſinne, and having the corruption of nature within them, do perſonally and individually ſhew the fruits of their own corruption in ſeeking out many inventions. The Iſraelites, as we have formerly heard, did corrupt themſelves, yet this was from their own natural corruption as the fountain. Secondly, when God made <hi>Adam</hi> in the beginning, he made him, and all mankind in him, upright; but they have ſought out many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions. For what the firſt man did, all his poſterity did in him and by him. Neither is it improper to aſcribe the particle [they] to the relations, actions and conditions of the firſt man. As for example, when the Lord ſaid <hi>let us make man in our own image, and let them have dominion over the fiſh of the Sea, and the fowle of the aire,</hi> Gen. 1.26. Theſe words are more immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken to <hi>Adam,</hi> and mediatly to all his poſterity, to the whole ſpecies of men, <hi>Let them have dominion over the fiſh of the Sea.</hi> So in the preſent caſe, it may be ſaid of <hi>Adam</hi> primarily, that God made man upright, but he and all mankind in him have ſought out many inventions. The deed of the firſt man, is the deed of the ſpecies or whole kind. As in a parallel caſe, the act of the firſt woman and the promiſe made to her are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to the whole ſex: <hi>ſhe ſhall be ſaved by child-bearing, if they continue in the faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.15. Thirdly, that no blame may be caſt upon God, we may ſay ſince the fall alſo, though men are born in original ſinne, God doth from time to time ſend inward convictions into their hearts to inable them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh betwixt good and evil. If therefore they will not ſee what they may ſee, but will fallaciouſly endeavour to finde out many inventions, the fault is meerely their own. All theſe paſſages are true, and being put together they ſhew the ſcope of the text, but they do not prove the purity of the natural birth.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:168516:78"/>
               <p> For the ſixth, ſeventh and eighth places which the Examiners do bring out of the Prophets, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.21.22. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.4, 5. I do not ſee how theſe or ſuch like do any way make to the purpoſe. For we will eaſily grant that <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> was a faithful City in the beginning, and that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful City did become an Harlot. We will grant alſo that the Jewiſh Church was the Lords Vineyard, planted with the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt Vine, and thorough her own default ſhe turned into the degenerate plant of a wild Vine, and brought forth wild grapes. Theſe and many more texts may be alledged to prove the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of that Church in her firſt inſtitution; but how doth this prove the purity of the natural birth, ſeeing that Nation had all theſe priviledges meerely by promiſe and Covenant? If they ſtand upon Analogy, and ſay that it is rational for God to do with all men as with that people. To this we anſwer though all are born in original ſinne and in the corruption of nature, yet they are not left in a helpleſs or hopeleſſe condition; Thorough Chriſt men have a poſſibility of ſalvation though thorough their own default they neglect this great ſalvation (as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did,) and are juſtly lyable to the ſame reproof.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, they go to that famous place in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> thy deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is of thy ſelf, O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but in me is thy help, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Here ſay they the Lord layes Iſraels deſtruction upon her ſelf, and not upon her firſt parents,</hi> page 70. Neither doth this any whit promote their cauſe, for if we do read the ſtories of the Judges and of the Kings, all along for the ſpace of nine hundred years, we ſhall find that the Church and ſtate of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were liable to a total &amp; final deſtruction, for theird Iolatry &amp; other great ſins; In this reſpect therefore the Prophet ſaith thy deſtruction is of thy ſelf, O <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And when they were at the brink of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction many times, and under the power of the enemy than the Lord did wonderfully come in to help them. And this is the meaning of the Prophets words, <hi>but in me is thy help.</hi> Thorough their own ſinne many times they were at the brink of ruine, but the Lord of his great mercy did deliver them. We may apply the caſe more generally, though <hi>Adam</hi> did fall and all mankind by his perſonal diſobedience, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:168516:78"/>is of themſelves, yet in and thorough Chriſt it may be ſaid in me is thy help. Secondly, this ſpeech is to be applied to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a people in covenant with God, that they are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their own deſtruction, but their help is immediately from him. So we, by our perſonal diſobedience do many times what lies in us, procure our own deſtruction, but our help is meerely from his grace. This is the full meaning of the place, and how doth this prove the purity of the natural birth? Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and children and all are the meritorious cauſe of their own deſtruction, if they be conſidered in immediate oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the goodneſſe of God, the cauſe of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>We will go on, and ſee whether they be more happy in the places which they cite out of the new Teſtament: For the tenth place, which they cite out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Except ye be converted and become as little children ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdome of God;</hi> Becauſe we have examined this text already, and the Cenſors ſay no more but that which Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> hath in ſubſtance ſpoken before, we are content to let them paſs in this matter.</p>
               <p>From the eleventh place they do conclude abſolutely, that infants are free from all kind of ſinne. Theſe are their words, <q>doth not the Apoſtle remove, not onely from children, mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, but alſo all evil of iniquity, when he would have the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians in that behalf conformed to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. ſaying, Brethren be not children in underſtanding, howbeit <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in malice or iniquity be children, <hi>page</hi> 70.</q> Here, as I have formerly touched is a palpable ſophiſme <hi>a dicto ſecundum quid ad dictum ſimpliciter,</hi> as Logicians terme it. For though the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the general notion thereof may ſignifie all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of iniquity, yet in the ſenſe of the text it noteth the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar evil of malice onely: and therefore he ſaith in malice be ye children. Neither is it his purpoſe to acquit children from all kind of malice or envy, for they have ſeminally and vertually the ſeed of all this in their hearts. <hi>Do ye think that the Scripture ſaith in vain, the ſpirit that is in us lusteth unto envy?</hi> Jam. 4.5. We ſee by experience that this is no fable, that envy is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeated in the heart of man; one child many times doth envy
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:168516:79"/>another for a little coat. And though God doth give to the Regenerate more grace to purge out the ſinne of the nature, as it is afterward expreſſed in the next verſe, <hi>but he giveth more grace, wherefore he ſaith, God reſiſteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble.</hi> Notwithſtanding all this the nature of man doth luſt to envy, and it is vertually and, eminally in infants. You will ſay then, why doth the Apoſtle exhort, in malice be ye chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? His meaning is this, that they ſhould do as children, who are apt to forget the wrongs and injuries that are done to them, and to look-upon them as though they had never been. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>be angry but ſinne not, let not the Sun go down upon your wrath,</hi> Epheſ. 4.26. This is all one, with that expreſſion, in malice be ye children; that is, do not retain heart-burnings and hatred one againſt another, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the wrongs and injuries that are done to you as children do. It is but a comparative ſpeech.</p>
               <p>Theſe are all the places of Scripture which are alledged by theſe Cenſors to prove the purity of the natural birth, and how well they have done it, we leave to any indifferent underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to judge: and yet how do they glory when they utter ſuch words as theſe, <hi>page</hi> 71? <q>Thus we have proved that neither the guilt of our firſt parents ſinne was imputed, nor their ſpiritual death in ſinne and corrupted nature was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to all their poſterity, or to any one of them by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary generation.</q> 
                  <hi>And directing their ſpeech to the Aſſembly after this manner, do thus inſult,</hi> 
                  <q>though this your doctrine (ſay they) hath gone from hand to hand a long time by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, yet neither did the Scribes and Phariſees, nor yet the diſciples of Chriſt, and much leſſe Chriſt himſelf, hold forth any ſuch doctrine, nor were any of them leavened with this opinion of yours, and your long miſtaken Predeceſſors. For the Phariſees with the Jewes being highly diſpleaſed with him, who was borne blinde, and whoſe eyes Chriſt had ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for defending his Saviour and bleſſed Oculiſt, ſaid thus unto him, <hi>John</hi> 9 34. Thou waſt altogether born in ſinne, and doeſt thou teach us? Whence it is evident that they did neither conceive all men in general, nor yet themſelves to be by propagation conceived and born in ſinne, <hi>page</hi> 71.</q> What
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:168516:79"/>apprehenſions and conceptions ſoever the Phariſees and other Jews had, I will not diſpute. Sure I am, they who do rightly underſtand the doctrine of the Jewiſh Church, could not well be ignorant of the ſinne of the nature. For when our Saviour did diſcourſe of the neceſſity of regeneration, and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did admire at the ſtrangneſſe of that doctrine, our Saviour made him this anſwer, <hi>Art thou a Maſter in Iſrael, and knoweſt not theſe things?</hi> John 3.7. In which words it is plain that the pollution of the natural birth, and the neceſſity of regeneration, were then points eaſie to be known; and a wonder it was to our Saviour that any could be ignorant of ſuch fundamentals. And I cannot but admire that theſe men, Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> and the thirty ſeparate Congregations, ſhould profeſſe themſelves to be members of the Chriſtian Church, and be ignorant of theſe things. But our Examiners build upon our Saviours words, <q>neither hath this man ſinned nor his parents, but that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him. Where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your doctrine (ſay they) our Saviour ſhould have anſwered poſitively, that both he and his parents with all his progenetors, even as farre as <hi>Adam,</hi> had ſinned.</q> What need was there at all, that our Saviour ſhould ſpeak of the common cauſe of the miſery of all mankind, ſeeing the Diſciples queſtion was more immediately touching the particular blindneſſe of this man? They were not ignorant that original ſinne was the common cauſe of all diſeaſes; onely they did put the queſtion, what was the proper cauſe of the blindneſſe of this individual man, whether it did lie in himſelf or in his parents, that he was born blind? In relation to this particular queſtion, for any eminency or ſingularity of ſinne above other men the anſwer is plaine, that neither he nor his parents have ſin'ned. This was the preſumption and ſingular opinion of the Phariſees, as it appeareth in the aforementioned words, <hi>Thou waſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together born in ſinne, and doſt thou teach us?</hi> The whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of this argument is a meere fallacy, <hi>à dicto ſecundum quid addictum ſimplicietr.</hi> They go on, and from the Lords appointing the Cities of refuge for the Man ſlayer to flee unto, when he had killed his Neighbour unawares, they reaſon, <q>The Lord commanded by <hi>Moſes</hi> that Cities of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:168516:80"/>ſhould be ſet apart in all the coaſts and habitations of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for ſuch to flee to; and will he purſue the innocent ſeed of <hi>Adam,</hi> and hold them guilty for their fathers ſinne, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated ere they were born? Yea, will he himſelf be the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger of the blood againſt theſe innocents? <hi>page</hi> 70.</q> In anſwer to this, I ſay, did theſe men ſeriouſly conſider the whole truth, they would not raiſe ſuch tragical cryes againſt this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. The Cities of refuge anciently appointed for the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer, were types and figures of Chriſt to come: To him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſoul is to fly, when ſhe is purſued by the curſe of the Law, as by an avenger of blood. So then, if all the children of <hi>Adam</hi> were lyable to the guilt of his ſinne perpetrated, before they were born, there is no harſhneſſe in the ſaying, if we beleeve that the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> doth open a door, to the grace that comes by Chriſt, and that the grace of Chriſt is a City of refuge, for the loſt ſinner to fly to; And for infants, though we hold them guilty of ſinne by the diſobedience of the firſt man, what detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or dammage is this to them, as long as mercy is extended through the obedience of the ſecond man. By all that I can underſtand, theſe men are afraid of nothing more than that Chriſt ſhould have too much honour given to him in releeving the miſerable loſt ſonnes of men, otherwiſe they would never ſtand ſo much as they do upon the purity of the natural birth.</p>

               <p>NOW let us heare what anſwers they return to our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And here I ſay they are extreamely fallacious; for as they do not produce ſome of our arguments, which have moſt cogent proof, ſo they do mention others, which are of ſmall moment, which is ſcarce honeſt dealing. But for the places which they do alledge, there are four in number, which do car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſome weight with them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, from that place <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. <q>for the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth, <hi>they gather thus much,</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:168516:80"/>Even as <hi>Eſau</hi> or <hi>Edom,</hi> though he had a birth-right, yet ſold it in his youth to ſatisfie ſome ſtrong deſires kindled in him: ſo men, though created innocent, do in the time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and tryall too often, and too ſoon, yield unto the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and ſell or forfeit that their innocency and birth-right, and ſo their imaginations become evil from their youth, but are not ſo from their birth, unleſſe you here underſtand a ſpiritual conception or birth in ſinne by our perſonal fall, <hi>page</hi> 71.</q> In this I do agree with them, that men in time of their tempration too often and too eaſily fall from God tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough their own actual diſobedience. This is a part, but it is not the whole truth, for if they had compared the text as they ſhould have done with <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 3.4, 5. they would finde that both Scriptures ſpeak of the ſinne of the nature. Firſt, the Lord ſaith, <hi>my Spirit ſhall not alway strive with man for that he alſo is fleſh,</hi> ver. 3. As who would ſay in plainer times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his nature is defiled I will deſtroy him from the earth. Secondly, the whole nature muſt needs be depraved, becauſe the principles and lively fountaines are corrupt, every imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thoughts of his heart are evil. Thirdly, the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of the depravation, it is not ſpoken of this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular imagination, but every imagination of his heart is evil, and that which is more, it is onely evil, without the combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, connexion and commixture of any good. Fourthly, the perpetuity of the time, in the one text it is ſaid the thoughts of his heart are onely evil continually, and in the other the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination of mans heart is evil from his childhood; If we put altogether, we may plainly ſee that there is a depravation of nature, that this depravation is generally in all parts, and in all times from the very birth and conception. And for that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Eſau</hi> which they alledge, that he ſold his birth-right, that primogeniture was a ſpecial priviledge in the family of the Patriarchs, but what is this to every mans natural birth-right? can he forfeit that natural innocency which he never had? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Eſau</hi> did ſell his birth-right at a certain time of his age, by a deliberate and a free choyce, when <hi>Jacob</hi> and he were come near to mans eſtate, and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let there be no profane perſon among you as Eſau, who for one morſel of meat
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:168516:81"/>ſold his birth right,</hi> Heb. 12.16. Now it is otherwiſe with the the words of the text, there, it is expreſſed that the thoughts of the imaginations of his heart are evil from his childhood. As much in ſenſe as that the whole nature is depraved, and that depravation doth beginne from the very birth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the texts cited out of <hi>Job,</hi> I do agree with the Examiners in the general, that thoſe wiſe men ſpeaking of the purity of God in relation to the imperfection of the creature, do oftentimes uſe an hyperbolical way of expreſſion. As in that paſſage of <hi>Eliphaz, behold he putteth no trust in his Saints, yea the heavens are not clear in his ſight,</hi> Job. 15.15. I do agree alſo that men do voluntarily corrupt themſelves; <hi>how much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable and filthy is man who drinketh iniquity like water?</hi> ver. 16. Though theſe things be true, yet they do not contain the whole truth nor the Emphaſis of that Scripture, for the words immediately going before, are concerning the natural generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man, <hi>what is man that he ſhould be clean, and he that is born of a woman that he ſhould be righteous?</hi> ver. 14. The ſame in ſubſtance is ſpoken by <hi>Job</hi> himſelf touching the natural birth, <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one,</hi> Chap. 14 4. Both Scriptures do plainly ſhew that the nature is defiled, becauſe it doth proceed from ſo unclean a fountain. And this doth agree with the doctrine of our Saviour, when he preſſeth a neceſſity of regeneration, <hi>that which is born of fleſh is fleſh,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a neceſſity that man ſhould be born again. The whole force of the argument is thus much in effect, from the greater to the leſſe; If the heavens and the Saints which are the more perfect creatures, are not pure in the ſight of God, what righteouſneſſe is in man, who is defiled with original ſinne even from the very birth? This is the natural ſenſe of the words of <hi>Eliphas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, to that place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <q>behold I was ſhapen in iniquity and in ſinne did my mother conceive me, they anſwer, We would (ſay they) Firſt, gladly know of you, whether it be not <hi>Davids</hi> ſcope in this confeſſion to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate his ſinne. But if he here pleadeth the inevitable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature, which you hold forth, his words will be
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:168516:81"/>found a meere extenuation of his offences, if not a throwing off all or moſt of the blame upon God, who had brought him forth ſo corrupt and averſe to all good, and ſo propenſe to all evil, and that without hope of an abſolute cure while he was in this world, <hi>page</hi> 75.</q> Where is the honeſty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of theſe men when they patch that upon others, which is none of their doctrine? For where can they ſhew that either the Aſſembly of Divines, or any other ſerious Authors, did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver teach that the nature of man is corrupt and propenſe to evil, without any hope of cure while he is in this world, and that in this caſe man doth lie under an inevitable neceſſity? Do not the Aſſembly of Divines, and all other Authors almoſt ſpeak of the Covenant of grace, after they have ſhewed the miſery of nature? For though the nature of man is wholly defiled, yet from Chriſt there is hope to have the nature cleanſed. Though <hi>David</hi> was born in original ſinne, yet he was not deſtitute of a remedy, he beleeved the grace of God made known in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and therefore prayeth, <hi>create in me a clean heart, renew in me a right ſpirit. He did deſire that his defilement by natural generation might be done away by the work of the new creation.</hi> And whereas theſe confident men would deſire to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not <hi>Davids</hi> ſcope in his confeſſion to aggravate his ſinne, I anſwer, it is, and therefore he doth cry out againſt the ſinne of the nature, he doth uſe the ſame expreſſion in effect as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>I know that in me, that is, in my fleſh, dwelleth no good thing,</hi> ver. 18. And <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> ver. 24. Where we may obſerve theſe three points. Firſt, they who are inwardly and truly enlightned, do feel the burden of a carnal mind, which they have by natural generation, whereas other men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the liberty of luſt their greateſt freedome. Secondly, they feeling the propenſion of their nature wholly to ſinne, do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon aggravate the ſinfulneſſe of their nature. Thirdly, by this means they do more highly prize the grace of Chriſt, and that freedome which he doth bring to ſet them at liberty from the bondage of corruption, and the reigne of their luſts, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.31 32, 33. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2, 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.20. The promiſe of Chriſt is, that <hi>a bruiſed reed he will not break, and the ſmoaking flax he will
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:168516:82"/>not quench untill he have brought forth judgment unto victory.</hi> By judgment is here meant deliverance from under the tyranny and reign of original ſin, when men ſerve divers luſts and pleaſures. The deliverance from the power of corruption is the judgment meant in the text. This deliverance is not wrought in an inſtant, but by degrees, and our Saviour is ready to help the weakeſt that flie to him in a ſenſe of their own miſery. There is nothing more weak than a bruiſed reed, and the leaſt degree of fire will make flax to ſmoak. Even ſo, if there be the leaſt grace to feel the bondage of corruption, the Lord Chriſt is ready to cheriſh it, and never to leave till he have brought forth judgment unto victory, to make men conquerors of their luſts. But the ground of all this, is, to feel the burden of a carnal mind, which it is moſt probable, theſe Cenſors are ſtrangers to, or elſe they would not ſo extenuate the ſin of the nature, as they do.</p>
               <p>Now let us heare what interpretation they give of the Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts words. It was, ſay they, <hi>the lie, or lying promiſes of Sathan, with the folly therein contained by which he was ſhapen in iniquitie, or conceived in ſin. pag.</hi> 74. And they ground themſelves upon that paſſage, that the devil is the father of ſin. Theſe are their words, <hi>beſides our natural parents, we have ſpiritual fathers and mothers, whether for our begetting in evil and iniquity, or for our regeneration in grace and goodneſſe. Concerning our procreation in ſin, our Saviour ſpeaks thus unto the Jewes,</hi> Joh. 8.44. <hi>Ye are of your father the Devil, and his luſts will ye do. Now this father makes uſe of a twofold mother to beget men in wickedneſſe, beſides their own lust, which when it is enticed and drawn away by temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, conceiveth and bringeth forth ſin.</hi> Jam. 1.14, 15. <hi>And here firſt they reckon the lying word or promiſe by which Sathan de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth men; and ſecondly the falſe Synagogue which thorough Sathans helps begets men in a falſe faith,</hi> Page. 75. 76. But this gloſſe will not ſerve their turn neither, for though the Devil be the father of ſin, he is ſo onely by temptation and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion; but the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh of ſin by derivation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation: <hi>I was ſhapen in iniquitie, and in ſin did my mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me.</hi> And for that which they alledge out of the Epiſtle of St. <hi>James,</hi> he doth onely ſpeak of the order of generation
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:168516:82"/>of ſin in the heart, <hi>every man is drawn away of his own luſt and enticed, and luſt when it hath conceived, bringeth forth ſin.</hi> But what is this to the purpoſe of the Pſalmiſt, he doth not ſpeak of the generation of luſt or of ſin in his heart, but he doth ſpeak of his own generation. This is evident from the words themſelves, <hi>I was ſhapen in iniquitie, and in ſin did my mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me.</hi> Secondly, it is manifeſt from the words that follow, becauſe he was defiled with the pollution of the natural birth, by way of oppoſition he prayeth unto the Lord to create in him a clean heart; becauſe his old was defiled, therefore he did beg a new nature.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to that place. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. And were by nature the children of wrath as well as others, they anſwer by a diſtinction, <hi>It is one thing,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to be ſinners from our firſt nativity, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing in time to become the children of wrath by our perſonal fall and actual diſobedience, which alſo coming to paſſe in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man, and by his default, we may truly be ſaid by nature to be the children of wrath, when ſin by cuſtome becomes a ſecond na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to us,</hi> Page. 78. Here I yield, that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> before their converſion, and all other natural men do thorough their own actual diſobedience ſerve divers luſts and pleaſures. This is the truth, but it is not the whole truth. If they were only defiled by cuſtome, which in a ſenſe may be called a ſecond nature, by good cuſtome then they need onely a remedy of the evil of their nature; and we need not the knowledge of Divinity, but onely of Moral Philoſophie toward the recovery out of our miſery. For that which is now the judgment of theſe Cenſors, was ſometimes the opinion of <hi>Aristotle:</hi> He did beleeve that man in his birth was like a white ſheet of paper, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the habit of vertue was attainable by many acts. But the Apoſtle doth not deal upon ſuch weak beggerly and Ethical grounds, becauſe the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were not only ſinners by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, but by nature alſo were the children of wrath, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in relation to their natural corruption, he ſaith, <hi>you hath he quickened which were dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes.</hi> Their quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening by the ſpirit <hi>a poſteriori</hi> doth ſhew the pollution of their natures <hi>a priori.</hi> But if they were the children of wrath only by cuſtome a ſecond nature, by breaking off old cuſtomes they
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:168516:83"/>might reduce themſelves to their ancient purity of nature. And this is the Moral Philoſophie of theſe Cenſors and the ſeparate Churches of this way.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, for that place of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin, Chap. 5. v. 12. That we may more orderly proceed, let us conſider how they plant their own interpretation, and then how they oppugne ours. <hi>This one man ſay they by whom ſinne entred into the world is not our firſt parent Adam, but our own earthly or natural man, which is called Adam and Edom from the earth of his foundation,</hi> pag. 78. Here I do plainly and openly confeſſe I do not know what they meane by this <hi>Adam,</hi> neither can I ſee how poſſibly they can apply ſuch a ſenſe to this Scripture. Firſt, ſeeing they will not have the nature of man to be defiled in <hi>Adam,</hi> how is this common nature called by the title <hi>of one man,</hi> ſeeing it containeth ſuch an infinite number of men? Secondly, how did ſin by this one man enter into the world? For this common nature of one man muſt either be nature pure, or nature impure. If they will have this to be meant of nature pure, then this neceſſarily muſt be the meaning of the text, by one common pure natural man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin, &amp;c. As this is a ſtrange and wild interpretation in it ſelf, ſo it doth caſt the blame only upon God for making ſuch a nature that by it generally death ſhould paſſe upon all men to condemnation. But if to amend the matter they ſhall ſay that he made the nature of <hi>Adam</hi> in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the nature of every man pure in natural generation, but it is their own fault that they corrupt themſelves. Here the plaiſter is not wide enough for the ſore, for the Apoſtle gives the reaſon why death paſſeth upon all men, becauſe in one all have ſinned. But now if it be true, as theſe Cenſors ſay, that in one common nature all have not ſinned, but thoſe only that fall through their perſonal diſobedience. Here I would have them to ſhew why doth death paſſe upon all men, and how will this ſatisfie the ſenſe of the Apoſtle? By their account then only they ſhould be lyable to death who were guiltie of diſobedience in their pure nature. But let us ſuppoſe that they ſay by one common nature impure ſin entred into the world, and then this will be a groſſe tautologie. Beſides, if the whole nature of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:168516:83"/>man be impure, there muſt be ſome cauſe of the general depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of nature, which will bring us to the diſobedience of the firſt man, and ſo they will loſe their cauſe. Further, I demand, if by one man they underſtand the common nature of all, how will they preſerve the <hi>Emphaſis</hi> of the Apoſtle in oppoſing one man to all men? He plainly ſaith that death hath paſſed upon all men, but how? thorough the means of one man. Again, how will they make it good, that by the diſobedience of one many were made ſinners, in caſe they take one man for the common nature of men. The acts of obedience or diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience are uſually attributed to particular perſons that live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome Law. But they have a better faculty to cavil at the truth than poſitively to maintain their own heterogeneal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
               <p>Let us hear then what cavils they have againſt the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the words. Firſt, ſay they, <q>this one by whom ſinne entred into the world, is not meant by our firſt parent <hi>Adam,</hi> for the Apoſtle ſhews that he was not the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or firſt ſinner, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14. For <hi>Adam</hi> was not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but the woman being deceived, was in the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. According to your doctrine then, the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid, by one woman ſinne entred into the world, <hi>page</hi> 78.</q> Indeed the ſcope of his doctrine, in that text is to ſhew that the woman was more immediately tempted by Satan, and ſhe was firſt in the tranſgreſſion; yet in the matter of propagating original ſinne, it is as true alſo, that by one man ſinne entred into the world. For <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> make but one root in the propagation of the kind: and therefore in the inſtitution of marriage it is ſaid, <hi>for this cauſe ſhall a man leave father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and cleave to his wife, and they twain ſhall be one fleſh,</hi> Gen. 2, 24. In the caſe then of Propagation, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> go but for one, and <hi>Adam</hi> is here immediately oppoſed to Chriſt, ſo farre forth as he is the root of all his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſay they, theſe words, <hi>And death paſſed upon all men</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>are thus to be rendred, in as much or ſo farre forth as all have ſinned,</hi> page 78. Well, let the words be rendred, which way they will, the ſcope of the text, and the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:168516:84"/>connexive particle, <hi>for,</hi> do plainly ſhew that they contain the reaſon of the general paſſage of death upon every individual man. And therefore we muſt neceſſarily and unavoidably come to the diſobedience of the firſt man, in whom, as in the common root all have ſinned.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they thus except, <hi>If the Apoſtle had beleeved any ſuch thing, as the reigning of death upon all men by the firſt mans ſinne, he would not have omitted that, and onely mentioned from Adam to Moſes,</hi> page 81. Though he doth ſpeak of the reign of death from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> he doth not hereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it to that particular time onely. For he plainly ſaith, that death paſſed upon all men, abſolutely and univerſally in all times, but he doth mention the time from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> in ſpecial, becauſe then it ſeemed to be more rational and congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that ſinne ſhould not be imputed, becauſe no Law was then publickly delivered; yet in this time he affirmeth, that all univerſally were under the reign of death: not onely <hi>Cain,</hi> the builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> the people of the old world, and the Cities of <hi>Sodom,</hi> all which were deſtroyed for their perſonal ſinnes; but he plainly affirmeth, that death reigned over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in all that interval of time, though they never ſinned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſimilitude of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion. If infants be under the raign of death, we muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe, that ſinne muſt be the cauſe thereof, but infants cannot commit any ſinne perſonally. Therefore they muſt be ſuppoſed to be guilty of ſinne through the diſobedience of <hi>Adam.</hi> And this makes good the main argument of the Apoſtle, <hi>by one man ſinne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world,</hi> he doth argue from the effect to the cauſe; becauſe death hath univerſally paſt upon all, by the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one, therefore all were involved in the guilt of that diſobedience.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſay they, <hi>the nineteenth verſe is more plain againſt univerſal corruption by the firſt mans diſobedience, for there the Apoſtle uſeth the word (many,) and ſaith, by one mans diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence many (not all) were made ſinners; therefore all did not fall in the firſt individual</hi> Adam, page 82. Though the word (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) be equivocal, yet in the ſenſe of the text it muſt neceſſarily be meant of every individual man, becauſe death hath abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:168516:84"/>paſſed upon every man, no one excepted, therefore it neceſſarily followeth that this paſſage, by the diſobedience of one, many were made ſinners, muſt be meant of every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual man. But here they have a cavil, <q>the word [many] in the latter part of the verſe muſt have the ſame latitude al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, for the Apoſtle ſetteth down a full compariſon of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals in that verſe. Here the verſe muſt be thus interpreted, that as by one mans diſobedience, all were made ſinners, ſo by one mans obedience, all were made righteous, <hi>page</hi> 82.</q> Neither will this help the matter, for it is not neceſſary that there ſhould be the ſame latitude in the collation betwixt the firſt and the ſecond man; onely this is ſufficient that the firſt man is the root of all his branches, and all that come of him were made ſinners by him; and the ſecond man is the root of all his branches, and all that are ingraffed into him, are made righteous by him. Secondly, ſome of them that ſtand for the univerſal redemption do not plead an abſolute or univerſal juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of all men by the obedience of the firſt man; but onely plead for a general impretation or poſſibility of ſalvation, which then onely comes to be applied when men believe and receive the promiſe by a lively faith.</p>
               <p>Thus, we have paſſed through all the arguments of the Examiners, and we have ſeen their cavils againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Scriptures alledged by us. As for thoſe ſimilitudes, of puniſhing the poſterity of Traitors, for the treaſon of their parents, and the killing of the young vipers with the old, by reaſon of their poyſonous nature, &amp;c. foraſmuch as theſe are onely illuſtrations of the truth, ſo all the pains which they take here is onely to cavil at illuſtrations. Other paſſages they have of leſſer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we have anſwered before, onely they have one argument in the Chapter of free will from that place, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 7.14. <hi>Before the child ſhall know to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the evil, and chuſe the good, the land which thou abhorreſt ſhall be forſaken of both her Kings.</hi> Here they would have us obſerve two points, Firſt, that <hi>though this place be commonly underſtood of our Saviour, yet it is meant of the common state of man. Secondly, this
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:168516:85"/>child from his infancy, according to the common ſtate of mankinde; ſhould have the knowledge and ability to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the evil and chooſe the good.</hi> From hence they do inferre, <hi>that a natural man can both will and act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his firſt integrity, untill he diſables and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts himſelfe.</hi> Further, they ſtand upon it, that a man hath a power to chooſe the good, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they cite the words of <hi>Moſes, Deuteronomie</hi> 30.19. <hi>I have ſet before you life and death, bleſſing and curſing, therefore chooſe life,</hi> page 126, 127, 128. If they did well underſtand the meaning of theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they would not pervert them to ſo ſtrange a ſenſe. For the Text in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> we do acknowledge, that the children in an ordinary way have a power to chooſe the good, and to refuſe the evil, when they come to yeares of diſcretion. But what kinde of good is here meant? not that good which is ſpiritual or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; for this they cannot chuſe without an inward work of the Spirit; but that good onely which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and civil, and this at yeares of diſcretion men are able to make choyce of. And for the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> I have ſet before you bleſſing and curſing, therefore chooſe life, &amp;c. To the clearing of this, Let us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh; Firſt what he ſpeaks of, and Secondly, the perſons to whom he ſpeaks. Firſt, if by chooſing the good, be meant the true God in oppoſition to all the Heathen gods of the Gentiles, here <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks to the Iſraelites, as to a people that had cleare evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and convictions, that there was no other God in all the world but theirs onely. And therefore he doth exhort them to chuſe the true God for their God. Secondly, if by chooſing the good be meant the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Lord their God with all their heart, and with all their ſoule, as it is implyed, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. then this word of command is given onely in relation to the word of promiſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. And the Lord thy God will circumciſe thine heart, and the heart of thy ſeed to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:168516:85"/>with all thy ſoul that thou mayeſt live. In immediate relation to this promiſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his wayes and to keep his commandments that thou mayest live,</hi> verſe 16. So then we do conclude that the ability to chooſe the good, is not from any natural power, but from the grace of God, and the word of promiſe.</p>
               <p>Thus I have gone thorough all the reaſons which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged either by Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> or the Examiners, the late Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones of the purity of natural birth. If they have any thing more to ſay for this, my deſire is that they would ſhew their ſtrength, or elſe confeſſe their wicked errors, and ſubmit to the clear evidence of truth. Now let us conſider the ſeveral and reſpective arguments of Dr. <hi>Jeremy Taylor,</hi> and what hath been lately ſaid by him concerning the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>

In ſo doing we muſt needs deſtroy rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration or the new birth; we muſt needs alſo evacuate the Baptiſme of the Spirit, ſo farre as it doth ſeal regeneration: humiliation for the birth, ſinne will be a meere <hi>non ens</hi> and the mortification of the ſinne of the nature will be a nullity. In a word, one of the chief ends of the Chriſtian faith (which is to put on the Chriſt-like diſpoſition) will be fruſtrated and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impaired. For what need I to put on the new diſpoſition, as it is from Chriſt the root of all grace and ſpiritual life; if there be no pravity and ſinfulneſſe of nature, from <hi>Adam</hi> the root of corruption? In Scripture the one is ſet forth as the immediate oppoſite to the other. But he further ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This ſinne brought upon Adam all that God threatned, but no more, a certainty of dying, together with the proper effects, and affections of mortality.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Beſides the affections of mortality, and the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of dying, this ſinne alſo brought upon <hi>Adam,</hi> the deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of original righteouſneſſe; and the depravation of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as afterwards ſhall be ſhewed. Next he ſeemeth to ſpeak more fairely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Man being left in the ſtate of pure naturals, could not by his own strength, arrive to a ſupernatural end, for eternal life being an end above our natural proportion, cannot be acquired by any natural means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this, and ſuch like paſſages of his, he doth ſeem to me, to croſſe his whole undertaking. One chief end of entit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his book (as may appear by the preface; <hi>The Doctrine and Practice of repentance, reſcued from popular errours;</hi> is the ſcand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al &amp; offence that he ſeemes to take at our Doctrine of original ſinne. For thinks he, if the nature be depraved, a neceſſity of ſinning will be introduced, and the natural liberty of the Will, will be taken away: and therefore in much compaſſion and tenderneſſe, he ſeemeth (to himſelf at leaſt) to vindicate the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:168516:87"/>truth, to make Religion more reaſonable, and intelligible: and to reſcue the Schooles, and Pulpits, from the rigour, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of the doctrines of ſuch a nature. But when all is done, he ſpeaks the ſame in effect, that we do. For if man being in his natural condition, by his own ſtrength, cannot arrive to a ſupernatural end, but needs the help of the Spirit: This being ſuppoſ'd, I will put it upon him, ſeriouſly to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame Spirit that helps a man out of this imaginary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, privation, and imperfection, is not as able alſo, to reſcue him from that inherent defilement, pravity, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the natural birth? The Spirit can do as much in the one, as in the other. And exhortations will be as uſeful in the one caſe, as in the other. What need then hath our Authour to raiſe up all this duſt? But he further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What gifts and graces or ſupernatural endowments God gave to Adam in his ſtate of innocency we know not, God hath no where told us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though he hath no where told us in ſo many letters, yet by collation of circumſtances, we may gather that <hi>Adam</hi> had the Spirit, and was a ſpiritual man before his fall. In the creation it is expreſſely ſaid, come, <hi>let us make man after our own image,</hi> Gen. 1. The Apoſtle doth declare wherein this image doth conſiſt, <hi>That concerning the former converſation, ye put off the Old man, which is corrupt according to deceitful luſts, and that ye be renewed in the Spirit of the mind, and that ye put on the New man, which after God is created in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe,</hi> Epheſ. 4.22 23, 24. In theſe words there are four particulars that ſeem to ſpeak faire for <hi>Adam,</hi> that he had the Spirit, and was a ſpiritual man before his fall. Firſt, it is ſaid that they ſhould put off the Old man, corrupt according to deceitful luſts; Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is of a different nature according to the condition of the ſubject-matter; there is a corruption of ſeeds, of graines, of metals, of the members of a mans body, but here the Apoſtle muſt needs ſpeak of the corruption of that which is ſpiritual. From whence we collect that the Old man, or the diſpoſition of the fleſh, is but the corruption of that holy and ſpiritual ſtate n which <hi>Adam</hi> was made.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:168516:87"/>
               <p> Secondly, it is ſaid, <hi>be ye renewed in the ſpirit of your minds;</hi> The word <hi>renewed</hi> doth import the reſtoring of a thing to that perfection, which ſometime it had in its firſt inſtitution. An houſe is renewed, not when it is built new from the ground, but when it is amended. When an infant is born into the world, it is not proper to ſay that he is renewed, but a man doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his ſtrength, when he doth recover it by degrees after a long ſickneſſe. So in the preſent caſe, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind,</hi> he ſpeaketh of the renovation of that knowledge, holineſſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe that <hi>Adam</hi> ſometimes had, but loſt it by his fall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is ſaid, <hi>after the image of him that created him.</hi> Though this is ſpecially meant of the new creature, yet it is with reſpect alſo to that paſſage in the old creation, <hi>let us make man after our own image.</hi> For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ſecundum Deum,</hi> according to God, is as much in effect, as after the likeneſs, ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and image of God who upon this account muſt needs be the pattern in both creatio'ns.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to put all out of queſtion it is expreſſely ſaid, which <hi>after God is created in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe.</hi> What difference ſoever there may be between <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, and the Saints in the ſtate of regeneration, certain it is, that holineſſe and righteouſneſſe muſt needs be the morality of the Law, and none can rationally deny, but that <hi>Adam</hi> was endued and inveſted with theſe two before his fall. By his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he was enabled to deale juſtly with man, and by his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he was carried out to know God, to love him, to delight in him, to fear him, and to take him as his chiefeſt good. All theſe particulars (expreſſing the ſpirituality and purity of the Law) do ſignifie to us that <hi>Adam</hi> had the Spirit, and was a ſpiritual man before his fall. Now let us go on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Receiving more by the ſecond Adam, than we loſt by the firſt, the ſons of God are now ſpiritual, which he never was that we can finde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That which he writes here, doth manifeſtly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict what he ſpeaks elſwhere, for page 383. He plainly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:168516:88"/>that original righteouſneſſe in <hi>Adam</hi> and habitual righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in the Saints; are all one. Theſe are his own words, <hi>if one ſinne</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>could naturally, and by a phyſical cauſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty destroy original righteouſneſſe, then every ones ſinne in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, can as well deſtroy habitual righteouſneſſe, becauſe that, and this differ not, but in their principle, not in their nature and conſtitution. And why ſhould not a righteous man as eaſily and as quickly fall from grace, and looſe his habits, as Adam did? natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it is all one,</hi> ſo farre he. To which we anſwer, <hi>Adam</hi> fell from original righteouſneſſe, becauſe he ſtood onely by the covenant of workes, the Saints do not fall from habitual righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, becauſe they have their ſtanding by the covenant of grace. But as to the point in hand, original righteouſneſs in <hi>Adam,</hi> and habitual righteouſneſſe in the Saints, he tells us, that both are one, and the ſame in eſſence and conſtitution and then again, he tells us, the ſons of God are ſpiritual, which <hi>Adam</hi> never was that he could finde. So great a faculty he hath to blow hot and cold in the ſame breath.</p>
               <p>Now he comes to explicate that Scripture, <hi>by one man ſin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world,</hi> Rom. 5. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſinne, ſaith he, entred into the world by Adam, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certaine, becauſe he was the first man. It must needs enter in him, becauſe it firſt comes in by the firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true that ſinne entred into the world by <hi>Adam,</hi> as the firſt man, but it is not the whole truth, for in ſuch a ſenſe (as he underſtands it) the old <hi>Pelagians</hi> may make good that poſition of theirs, that original ſinne is by imitation they that come after, do onely imitate the enſample of him that went before. Of the entrance of death by ſin he ſpeaketh as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Death by ſinne, that is death, which at the firſt was the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature became a puniſhment upon that account, juſt as it was with the Scrpent to creep upon his belly, and the woman to be ſubject to her husband.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In theſe words of his, he doth diſtinguiſh between death as a meere condition of nature, and death as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The former he will have to be in the ſtate of innocency,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:168516:88"/>latter only to be introduced by the fall. But againſt this I have many things to alledge.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have dyed in innocency, and that meerely by the condition of his nature, what can we poſſibly make of the ſenſe of that commination, <hi>in the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye the death?</hi> what propable interpretation can we give of thoſe Scriptures, <hi>by one man, ſinne entred into the world, and death by ſinne. The wages of ſinne is death,</hi> Rom. 6. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lt?</hi> Surely all this plainly ſheweth, that death came into the world, meerely by the ſinne of man, and if he had not ſinned he had not dyed. Further, the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>the laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.16. The queſtion is, when did death begin to be an enemy, and from what time are we to fetch the date thereof? If <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have dyed in innocency, than the enmity of death muſt begin in Paradiſe, we muſt fetch the date of it from the creation and not from the fall. And ſo conſequently death will be rather the work of God, than the fruit of ſinne. But let it be ſuppoſed in this low and dimuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſe, that death came into the world as a puniſhment and began to be penal at the fall onely. If we take the matter in this ſenſe it will not ſerve his turn neither, nor will other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of his doctrine, abide the rigour of this interpretation. For how often doth he plead after this manner? <q>In other caſes, ſaith he; Lawes be not given to Ideots, infants, and perſons uncapable: why ſhould they be given here? In all caſes of the world, it is unjuſt to lay the ſinne of the father upon the children, and is it otherwiſe in this caſe onely? And if the anſwer may be admitted, any man may ſuffer for the ſinne of any father, becauſe it may be ſaid here as well as there, that although the innocent muſt not periſh for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers fault, yet the ſon is not innocent as being in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers loynes when the fault was committed, and the Law calls him and makes him guilty?</q> Many ſuch Aphoriſmes he hath, where he ſheweth or at leaſt endeavours to ſhew how contrary it is to the juſtice and mercy of God, any way to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> with the guilt of his ſinne. And yet here he confeſſes plainly and openly, that death <hi>quatenus,</hi> a puniſhment in the penalty of it, came into the world by the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:168516:89"/>diſobedience of the firſt man: How he can make one part of his doctrine to agree with the other, it paſſeth all underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of mine to diſcerne? In his anſwer to the Biſhops letter he ſeemeth to me to let fall a ſtrange contradiction: <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>the plain words of Saint Paul, death paſſed upon all men, foraſmuch as all have ſinned, all men, that is, the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mankind, all that lived till they could ſinne; Others that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, dyed in their nature, not in their ſinne, neither Adams, nor their own, ſave onely that Adam brought it upon them, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left it to them, himſelf being diſrob'd of all that could hinder it. Anſw.</hi> let page 49. Here in the former part of his words, he ſaith, that infants dye in their nature, not in their ſinne, neither <hi>Adams</hi> nor their own; and yet he tells us again, that <hi>Adam</hi> brought in death upon them, and through his diſobedience they were diſrobed of all that could hinder it: If he did bring in death upon them, then they did not dye purely in their own nature; they muſt ſome way die in or by his ſinne. Again, if they dyed purely in their own nature, and not at all in his ſin, how can he be ſaid to bring in death? Can he bring in death, and can he not bring in death? and all this upon one ſort of people, at one and the ſame time? Neither can I ſee, how he will acquit himſelf, if it ſhould be put upon him to ſhew the true reaſon why infants are lyable to burning feavours, convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion fitts, and paſſe through the pangs of death at laſt: Are theſe the infelicities of nature? Then God hath made them in this ſtate, and their miſery will be purely the work of his own hands. Are theſe the puniſhment of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne? then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent child will bear the burden of his fathers iniquity, in ſuch a caſe where it is not poſſible for the ſon to follow the fathers enſample, which is plainly to give up the cauſe. Now let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what he ſaith of the quality of the perſons upon whom there hath been ſuch a paſſage of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Death</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>paſſed upon all men, that is, upon all the old world, who were drowned in the flood of divine vengeance, and who did ſinne after the ſimilitude of Adam, and therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle St. Paul addes that for a reaſon, inaſmuch as all men have ſinned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though the word <hi>all</hi> in it ſelf hath an ambiguity in it, yet
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:168516:89"/>the ſcope of the text, &amp; the condition of the ſubject, doth plainly demonſtrate that the paſſage of death from <hi>Adam</hi> as a common root muſt be abſolutely upon all men, as men ſo farre forth as they are his ſonnes, and not upon all to the flood only. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter we have his meaning more fully in the next paſſage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If all men</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>have ſinned upon their own account, as it is certaine they have, then theſe words can very well mean that Adam firſt ſinned, and all his ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſinned after him: and ſo dyed in their own ſinne by a death, which at the firſt, and in the whole conſtitution of affaires is natural, and a death which their own ſinne deſerved, but yet was hastned and aſcertained upon them for the ſin of their Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In theſe words of his, as plauſibly as he ſeems to ſpeak of the cauſe of death, he puts that for the cauſe which is not the cauſe, and where he ſpeaks of the true cauſe, it doth not anſwer the ſenſe of the text.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he puts that for the cauſe, that is not the cauſe. For, from what Scripture, or from what conſequence of Scripture doth he prove it, that <hi>Adam</hi> and his ſonnes in the whole conſtitution of affiaires ſhould have dyed a death that is natural; The Scripture doth every where make death to be the fruit of ſinne, as we have formerly proved. Againe, it is moſt true, that men dye, becauſe by their own ſinne they deſerve death, but the ſcope of the Apoſtle is here onely concerning the diſobedience of the firſt man, and the paſſage of death upon all by the account of his ſinne. That which is the principal cauſe of death, at leaſt to the purpoſe in hand, he looks upon it as a buſineſſe by the by; In the next words he cometh to deliver himſelf more clearly for ſpeaking of the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> he addeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sin propagated upon that root and vicious enſample, or rather from that beginning, not from that cauſe, but</hi> dum ita peccant, &amp; ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militer moriuntur. <hi>If they ſin ſo, then ſo ſhall they die, ſo Saint</hi> Hierom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This paſſage, though it be clothed with the words of <hi>Hierom,</hi> it hath the ſenſe of the <hi>Pelagians:</hi> For obſerve what
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:168516:90"/>he ſaith <hi>ſin is propagated from that vicious enſample,</hi> it doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from <hi>Adam</hi> not ſo much as a cauſe, but as a beginning, and ſo far as men tread in his ſteps they are lyable to the ſame puniſhment. In his anſwer to the Biſhops letter, he brings in an enſample to confirme this way of expoſition, theſe are his own words: <q>To this purpoſe we have an enſample of Gods tranſmitting the curſe from one to the other. Both were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but one was the Original of the curſe or puniſhment. So ſaid the Prophet to the wife of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 Kings 14.16. He ſhall give <hi>Iſrael</hi> up becauſe of the ſins of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who did ſinne and made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſinne. <hi>Joroboam</hi> was the roote of the ſin and of the curſe: here it was alſo, that I may uſe the words of the Apoſtle, that by the ſin of one man, <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> ſin went into all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the curſe, captivity or death by ſinne, and ſo death went upon all men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> inaſmuch as all men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> have ſinned.</q> So far he, <hi>page</hi> 32. By this inſtance of his it is cleare, that Original ſin muſt paſſe into the world, not ſo much by propagation as by imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did walke in the wayes of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> that made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin, and thereupon the curſe, captivity and death came upon all the whole ſucceſſion, and upon all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſo far forth as they did walk in his waies and did follow his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſample. If this be a parallel caſe we muſt ſay, ſin, the guilt of ſin, and the curſe for ſin came into the world only by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and command of the firſt man, and all his poſterity are ſo far forth involved in his ſinne, as they walk after ſuch an injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and imitate that enſample. Now if this be ſo, I will leave it to any man to judge whither this gloſs will go at laſt. The Apoſtle ſaith that the <hi>firſt man is the figure of him that is to come.</hi> If therefore we are implicated in the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> no otherwiſe, but by obeying his command, and following his enſample. Our ſalvation by Chriſt will chiefly conſiſt in our imitating of him, and in obedience to his commands. As for the merit of his blood, the worth of his paſſion, the imputation of his righteouſneſſe, all this muſt be ſet apart as a matter of little uſe and ſmall profit. Having done with his own he cometh to paraphraſe upon the expoſition given by us.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:168516:90"/>
               <p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—<hi>forasmuch as all have ſinned, ought to be expounded thus; death paſſed upon all men, in whom all have ſinned, meaning that in Adam we really ſinned, and God doth truely and justly impute his ſin to us, to make us as guilty, as he that did it, and as much puniſhed and lyable to eternal damnation: and all the force of this great fancy, relyes upon this expoſition of</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to ſignifie in him, this we plainly deny. Our interpretation is grounded upon the ſcope of the text. For let us ſuppoſe the words to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued in his ſence. <hi>Foraſmuch as all have ſinned,</hi> when he hath done all that he can, he muſt come to the interpretation given by us. For the drift of the Apoſtle in the former words, is not only to ſhew that ſinne hath paſt upon all men, and death by ſin; but he ſpeaks of ſuch a paſſage of ſinne and death upon all men <hi>out of one man;</hi> If therefore, there be ſuch a general paſſage of ſin and death upon all out of one man, then virtually, and interpretatively all muſt ſin in one man. Againe, in the ſubſequent verſes the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that the firſt Adam is the figure of him that is to come,</hi> If you ask how and wherein, we muſt needs ſay from the whole ſeries of the text, that they are two publick perſons, and two repreſentatives of the kind. By this account then the diſobedience of the firſt man, muſt be virtually the act of all, and what he did they did in him, and by him: So then our interpretation is founded upon the whole ſcope of the context. As for his Critisciſmes we will leave them to ſuch who have more leaſure to buſy themſelves about words, we will follow him as he goes on in expounding the ſenſe of the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nevertheleſſe death reigned from Adam to Moſes even over them that bad not ſinned after the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſſion, who is the figure of him that is to come: By which diſcourſe it appears that St. Paul doth not ſpeak of all mankind, as if the evil occaſion by Adams ſin did diſcend for ever upon that account, but it had a limited effect and reached onely to thoſe that were in the interval between Adam and Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But if the matter be well conſidered there is no ſuch
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:168516:91"/>collection to be made from the diſcourſe of the Apoſtle. Indeed he ſpeaketh of the reigne of death over thoſe that lived in the interval between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes;</hi> but ſhall we argue from thence that the evil occaſioned by the fall did diſcend to them onely, and go no further? This cannot be, for afterwards the Apoſtle drawing a parallel between both <hi>Adams,</hi> hath theſe words: <hi>If through the offence of one, many be dead, much more the grace of God; and the gift by grace, which is by one man Jeſus Chriſt hath abounded unto many.</hi> Now then if we ſhall ſay, by the offence of one, many be dead, and underſtand this many, or mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in a limited ſence; namely, of ſuch only that lived in the interval between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> by this account, ſuch a number alone will ſtand oppoſite to the many that have life and grace by Chriſt. Nay, that which is more, the fore-mentioned number might in their time only look to one man the Lord Jeſus for recovery out of ſin and death, and ſo the Goſpel will be delivered to the conſolation of ſuch only that lived in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned interval between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes;</hi> And ſo we that live in the latter ages of the world, ſhall have nothing to do with the Goſpel, nor the Goſpel with us. But of this I have formerly ſpoken in my anſwer to Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> and the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miners: There I have ſhewed the reaſon why the Apoſtle doth mention the reigne of death in the interval between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes.</hi> He goes on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This death</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was brought upon them by Adam, that is, death which was threatned to Adam only, went forth upon them alſo who indeed were ſinners, but not after the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſſion, that is, who ſinned not ſo capitally as be did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This expreſſion <hi>death threatned only to Adam,</hi> hath ſome ambiguity in it: If he ſpeaks of <hi>Adam</hi> as a particnliar perſon, death was not only threatned to him, for in the preſent caſe he is to be looked upon as the common roote of the nature, when he fell, all mankind fell in him, from him death paſſed upon all, not only as ſinners in their own perſon, but in that formality as made ſinners, or ſinful by his diſobedience. Of infants it is true as well as others, in <hi>Adam</hi> all dye, and ſo death paſſeth upon all. Next he telleth us what it is to ſin like <hi>Adam.</hi>

                  <hi>To ſin like Adam</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is uſed as a tragicall and high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: ſo it is in the Prophet, they like men have tranſgreſſed: ſo we read it, but in the Hebrew it is, they like Adam have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grest, and yet death paſſed upon them that did not ſin after the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the text in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> our <hi>Engliſh</hi> tranſlation may well paſſe by an Enallage of the number. <hi>They like man,</hi> that is, like fickle and inconſtant men have tranſgreſt my Covenant. Or, if this will not ſatisfie, that of <hi>Tremellius</hi> may obtaine <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam hominis tranſgreſſi ſunt faedus;</hi> They have played faſt and looſe with me, as if it were no other but a meer Covenant of man. But let us take the words in the ſence that is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to him, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Prophet here looks to <hi>Adam</hi> as the head of all Apoſtates, and that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had ſinned in as tragical a manner as <hi>Adam</hi> did: what doth he infer from hence? he tells us, <hi>that death reigned from Adam to Moſes over thoſe that had not ſo tragically ſinned as Adam had done.</hi> Truely the old world that was drowned in the flood, <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> that were burnt with fire, the builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> whoſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was confounded; theſe, and ſuch like ſinners (though they lived in the interval between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi>) were none of the leaſt. But let us take it in his own ſence, that death reigned over <hi>Abel, Seth, Noah,</hi> and others that did not ſin ſo capitally as <hi>Adam</hi> did. If this be well conſidered, it doth make more for our purpoſe, than it doth for his: For theſe holy men that lived in the interval between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> were under the reigne of death. Here I demand how came they to be under this reigne? If he will ſay their own ſinne was the principal cauſe, how will he anſwer the words of the Apoſtle, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely tells us, by <hi>one mans offence, death reigned over all,</hi> ver. 17. Againe, if he ſhall ſay they came under this power by the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> then he makes good the interpretation given by us, that by the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> infants as well as others, in all that interval between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> came under the power and ſovereignty of death.

                  <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was ſo exaſperated with mankind, that being angry, would ſtill continue that puniſhment, even to leſſe ſinnes and ſinners,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:168516:92"/>which he only had firſt threatned to</hi> Adam, <hi>and ſo</hi> Adam <hi>brought it upon them. They indeed in rigour, did themſelves deſerve it, but if it had not been for that provocation by</hi> Adam, <hi>they who ſinned not ſo bad, and had not been ſo ſeverely and expreſſely threatned, had not ſuffered ſo ſeverely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By the tenour of the Doctrine we may underſtand, that men by their own ſins do deſerve death; as for the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> by this account it is only an aggravating circumſtance, and a cauſe meerly of the ſeverity of the ſentence. Now if this be ſo, how ſhall we expound the meaning of the Apoſtle? <hi>By one man ſin entred into the world and death by ſin, and death paſſed upon all men.</hi> He ſpeaketh of the entrance of ſinne, of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of death, of the entrance of ſin and death, upon all by the ſin and diſobedience of one man. Is all this only to make <hi>Adams</hi> ſin a meer acceſſory, or aggravating circumſtance? away with ſuch a conceit. The text doth pitch upon it as the principal and general cauſe of death. Againe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>by the offence of one, death reigned by one:</hi> If all men fall under the reigne of death by the offence of one, then certainly his offence is not the cauſe alone why they are more ſeverely dealt with: but it is the very cauſe why they fall under the power and dominion of death it ſelfe. Shall we make a circumſtance of that which is the principal cauſe: Further, what is the reaſon that infants dye, ſeeing perſonally and individually they are guilty of no ſin of their own to deſerve death? in his anſwer to the Biſhops letter he doth not ſhunne to affirme, that death comes upon infants meerly by right of dominion. <hi>But then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the evil of puniſhment may paſſe further than the action. If it paſſes upon the innocent it is not a puniſhment to them, but an evil inflicted by right of dominion, yet by reaſon of the relation of the offlicted to him that ſinned, to him it is a puniſhment. But if it paſſeth upon others that are not innocent, then it is a puniſhment to both, to the firſt principally to the deſcendants or relatives for the others ſake his ſinne being impured ſo far:</hi> and more he hath to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 43. Here he plainly delivers his opinion that death is inflicted upon others, becauſe they do partake with <hi>Adam</hi> in his ſinne, but it deſcends and comes upon infants meerly by way of prerogative and abſolute dominion. And if
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:168516:92"/>their death be a puniſhment it is ſo only to <hi>Adam</hi> in as much as they ſtand related to him as being his deſcendants and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. Againſt this I have ſome things to oppoſe. Firſt, in his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num neceſſarium,</hi> pag. 403. He layeth down this as a ſure axiom. <hi>When Godnſing the power and the dominion of a Lord, and the ſeverity of a Judge doth puniſh poſterity, it muſt be ſo long as the Parents may live, and ſee it, and ſo out of Chryſoſtome he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it to be to the third and fourth generation and no longer.</hi> Now here I argue, if God puniſheth <hi>Adam</hi> in his infant chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, this is not to the third and fourth, but to the hundreth generation. Againe, why ſhould he be puniſhed in his infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children when he hath been dead many hundred, nay certaine thouſand years agoe! ſhall he only be puniſhed and never ſurvive or live ſo long, as to ſee the puniſhment? againe, the words of the Apoſtle are cleare: <hi>as by the offence of one, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came upon all men to condemnation,</hi> ver. the 18. If it came upon all men? it came upon infants as well as others, and if it came upon all to condemnation, then infants beare the guilt of ſin, the infelicities, miſeries and paines of death, not by way of ſovereignty, but as a puniſhment and judgement laid upon them for their ſin and diſobedience of the firſt man. But to colour the matter, he hath a reſtriction in his anſwer to the Biſhops letter. <q>Now then your Lordſhip (ſaith he) ſees that what you note of the meaning of <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:168516:93"/>upon him, that is, it ſhould actually bring them under the reigne of death, <hi>pag.</hi> 45, 46.</q> By theſe words of his it is cleare that the curſe doth deſcend upon infants, not when they are borne in ſin, for he doth own no ſuch ſin of the nature, but it deſcends only to their real condemnation when they come to act ſinne. Here I would entreat him to conſider the words of the Apoſtle, ſo by <hi>the righteouſneſſe of one man the free gift came upon all men to juſtification of life.</hi> If it came upon all men, it came upon infants &amp; if the bleſſing of Chriſt doth come upon infants, ſurely the curſe alſo muſt deſcend upon them. For we cannot imagine any to be made partakers of the bleſſing, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, grace, and life by the ſecond man, but he muſt be ſome way involved in the guilt, miſery, death, and condemnation, brought in by the firſt. On the contrary if he will ſay that the curſe doth not deſcend upon infants, by the rule of proportion it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that infants ſhall have no part in the comforts, priviledges, and bleſſings that come by the Goſpel. And truely this muſt be the upſhot of this diſmal doctrine. Now let us conſider what expoſition he giveth of thoſe words, by the diſobedience of one, many were made ſinners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which I dwell and rely upon, is this: ſinne is often uſed in Scripture for the puniſhment of ſinne, and they that ſuffer are called ſinners, though they be innocent; ſo it is in this caſe, by Adams diſobedience, many were ſinners, that is, the ſinne of Adam paſſed upon them, and ſate upon them with evil effect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We do not deny but the word ſinne may be taken for the puniſhment of ſinne, and to that purpoſe what he ſpeaketh of <hi>Bathſheba, I and my ſonne Solomon ſhall be ſinners,</hi> but more eſpecially that of our Saviour, <hi>he made him ſinne for us, that knew no ſinne:</hi> Theſe, and ſuch like paſſages which he hath, <hi>page</hi> 368, &amp;c. We do not deny the truth of them in the general: Only this we ſay, that we are not onely made ſinners by imputation, but alſo we derive a ſinful nature from <hi>Adam</hi> by propagation, and by contagion. For Firſt: If there were onely an imputation of guilt, and no inherent corruption, men would bear the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and puniſhment of ſinne without cauſe, and God would puniſh ſinne where none is. Our Saviour indeed was made ſin,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:168516:93"/>who knew no ſinne, becauſe he came in the nature of a Surety: But the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> are no ſureties, they muſt be ſome way ſinners themſelves, if they will righteouſly bear the burthen of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne. Again, the words of the Apoſtle are moſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical, <hi>by the diſobedience of one, many were made ſinful,</hi> for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doth note, one that hath the habit of ſinne, that is, a ſinful man as I have proved in the former part of the Treatiſe, from whence we collect, that the ſonnes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> are not onely made ſinners by imputation, but ſinful alſo by hereditary contagion. Further, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted ſinners, or ſinful. This expreſſion, if it be ſeriouſly conſidered, is ſet in immediate oppoſition to the conſtitution of things in the creation. If a reaſon be demanded concerning the Sun, Moon, and Starres, of the ebbing and the flowing of the Sea, of the viciſſitude of Winter and Summer; The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is eaſie, all theſe things have their being, becauſe God made them and conſtituted them ſo in the beginning. But if a reaſon be demanded, how all men came to be ſinners by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and ſinful by propagation? the anſwer is as eaſie: They are made and conſtituted, as by the diſobedience of the firſt man, ſo by the juſt judgment of God upon that diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. If the ſinfulneſſe of nature be not by the fall, it muſt come by creation, or ſome other reaſon muſt neceſſarily be aſſigned to make all men ſo unanimous and univerſal in matter of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Laſtly, the Apoſtle draweth a parallel between both the <hi>Adams, as by the diſobedience of one, many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one, many ſhall be made righteous.</hi> Now it is evident none are made righteous by imputation in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, but they do in ſome meaſure or other partake of the life and ſpiritual nature of Chriſt, as the ſeccond <hi>Adam.</hi> Therefore we ſay on the contrary part, there are none that have the guilt of the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> imputed to them but they muſt alſo derive the pollution of nature from him as the root of corruption. But to this he hath a ſolution, (as he pretends at leaſt) in his anſwer to the Biſhops letter. <hi>This is ſufficient</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for the Apoſtles argument, and yet no neceſſity to affirme that we are ſinners any more than by imputation: for we are by Chriſt made juſt no other wiſe than hy imputation,</hi> page 38, &amp;c. To
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:168516:94"/>which we reply, the queſtion is not about the formal reaſon of our juſtification, which we acknowledge to be by the alone im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt: But the point in hand is, whether any be juſtified by the blood which are not ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Spirit. So in the preſent caſe, we ſay none have the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, but ſuch onely that partake of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; For in the next Chapter, when the Apoſtle cometh to ſpeak of ſanctification, he hath theſe words, <hi>know ye not that our Old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſinne might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,</hi> Rom. 6.6. By the old man, he means the ſinful diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the fleſh derived from <hi>Adam</hi> the root of corruption. So then the Scripture plainly doth ſhew that the oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both the <hi>Adams,</hi> doth not onely ſtand in imputation of guilt, but alſo in the propagation of the nature. And it is a great wonder that any exception can be made againſt ſo plain a truth. Thus, I have paſſed through all the material objections, and we have ſeen all of moment that can be ſaid, if it might be poſſible to take this Scripture out of our hands. Now he comes to forme the ſtate of the queſtion, to ſhew how farre he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes original ſinne, and where he differs from us? Becauſe this is the foot of the work, let him deliver himſelfe in his own words. <q>
                     <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne (ſaith he) was puniſhed by an expulſion out of Paradiſe, in which was a tree appointed to be the cure of diſeaſes and the conſervatory of life. There was no more told as done, but this and its proper conſequents. He came into a land leſſe bleſſed, a land which bore thiſtles and bryars, &amp;c.</q> And then he addeth thus, <q>death came in not by any new ſentence or change of nature: for man was created mortal, and if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, he ſhould have been immortal by grace, that is, by the uſe of the tree of life; and now being driven from the place where the tree grew, was left in his own natural conſtitution, that is, to be ſick and dye without that remedy.</q> And he further explaineth himſelfe, <hi>pag.</hi> 372. <q>This evil which is the condition of all our natures, <hi>viz.</hi> to dye, was to ſome a puniſhment, to others not ſo. It was a puniſhment to all that ſinned both before <hi>Moſes</hi> and ſince, upon the firſt it fell as a conſequent of Gods anger upon <hi>Adam,</hi> upon the latter it fell as a conſequent of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:168516:94"/>that anger threatned in <hi>Moſes</hi> his law. But to thoſe that ſinned, not at all as infants and innocents, it was meerly a condition of their nature, and no more a puniſhment than to be a child is. It was a puniſhment of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, becauſe by his ſin humane nature came to be diſrobed of their preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural immortality, and therefore upon that account they dye. But as it is related to the perſons, it was not a puniſhment, not an evil inflicted for their ſake, or any guiltineſſe of their own properly ſo called.</q> And then going on, he ſaith, we <hi>finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in Scripture exprest to be the effect of</hi> Adams <hi>ſin, and beyond this without authority we muſt not go.</hi> Turning his ſtyle againſt us, he addeth, <hi>other things are ſaid, but I finde no warrant for them in that ſence as they are uſually ſuppoſed, and ſome of them in no ſence at all.</hi> Then he cometh to particularize, <hi>The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>commonly reckoned, are that from</hi> Adam, <hi>we derive an original ignorance, a proneneſſe to ſin, a fomes or neſt of ſin imprinted and placed in our ſouls, a loſſe of our wills, liberty, and nothing elſe left, but a liberty to ſin; which liberty upon the ſumme of affaires is expounded a neceſſity to ſin, and the effect of all is, we are borne heires of damnation.</hi> Theſe are the particulars which he excepts againſt, and theſe he endeavours with all his might to oppugne: we will go in the ſame method as he doth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with original ignorance, he thus ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is true</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that we derive it from our Parents, I meane, we are borne with it, but I do not know that any man thinks, that if</hi> Adam <hi>had not ſinned that ſin,</hi> Cain <hi>ſhould have been wiſe as ſoon as his navel had been cut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We cannot ſo preciſely determine what <hi>Adams</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould have been in innocency, becauſe he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo long to beget a child in that pure eſtate, yet I think none may doubt, had he begotten children in that eſtate, he had conveied the ſame image of God, the ſame knowledge (reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the kind of it) that himſelfe was created in. And though in reſpect of actual knowledge, <hi>Cain</hi> ſhould not have been wiſe as ſoon as his navel was cut, yet in reſpect of potential know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he ſhould have been borne in a capacity, and by degrees ſhould have attained the ſame knowledge as <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe was created in. But he further argues.</p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:168516:95"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>If he had ſo great knowledge</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is likely that he would not ſo cheaply have ſold himſelfe and all his hopes out of a greedy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to get ſome knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle St. <hi>Jude</hi> tells us. <hi>The Angels that left their firſt habitation, are kept in chaines of darkneſſe to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great day,</hi> v. 6. Shall we ſay then, becauſe they did ſo cheaply leave their firſt habitation, was there no ſuch dignity or excellency in it? The way of reaſoning is one and the ſame in ſubſtance. He goeth on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The state of ignorance we do derive from</hi> Adam <hi>as we do our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is a ſtate of ignorance, and all manner of imperfection, but whether it was not imperfect, and apt to fall into forbidden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, we may beſt gueſſe it by the event.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We may gueſſe by the event, that he was made in a ſtate from which he might fall, but this doth no way hinder his being a ſpiritual man, or that endowment of ſpiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which he had before his fall. Firſt, by his fall he did loſe in his judgement, he and all mankind did fall from faith to unbelief; and hence it is, that ever ſince for happineſſe all men rely upon their own wit, learning, beauty, ſtrength, friends, riches, nobility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This plainly ſheweth, that <hi>Adam</hi> at the firſt was made in a ſtate of dependance upon the true God, which could not be, but he muſt be endued with a great meaſure of ſpiritual knowledge, and in his judgement at leaſt he muſt diſcerne that excellency that is in God. Further, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>ye have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him,</hi> Col. 3.10. By knowledge he doth not point ſo much to that which is literal, hyſtorical, and textual, but to that which is ſpiritual, by which the Saints come to be cloathed with a new nature. Secondly, (he ſaith) <hi>is renewed,</hi> which importeth the reſtitution of that knowledge that man once had, but had loſt by his fall. In a ſence therefore we may ſay, that the knowledge of the Saint is a kinde of remembrance, and that ſaying of <hi>Plato</hi> is not to much out of the way. Thirdly, is renewed in knowledge <hi>after the image of him that created him.</hi> This plainly ſheweth, that in the old and the new creation a man is made after the image of God, and this image doth principally ſtand in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineneſs
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:168516:95"/>of the light. Some differences there are between the knowledge which <hi>Adam</hi> had before his fall, and the knowledge that is renewed in the Saints, <hi>Adam</hi> had it by creation, they have it by inſpiration: <hi>Adam</hi> could propagate it to his poſterity, they cannot propagate it to poſterity: <hi>Adams</hi> knowledge was without the ſight of his miſery, their knowledge when they do begin to know as they ought to know, doth begin with the ſight of their miſery: Laſtly, <hi>Adams</hi> knowledge was not ſo perfect, but the Saints knowledge ſhall be moſt perfect in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, when they come to live in the ſtate of glory. Theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances conſidered reſpecting the manner, there is ſome difference to be made; yet in ſubſtance both kinds of knowlege is one and the ſame. For though it did not belong to <hi>Adam</hi> to know his miſery, and to believe in a Chriſt, yet the righteouſneſs of the moral law did appertaine to him. It did belong to him to love God, to feare him, to truſt in him, to obey him, &amp;c. Now how could all this poſſibly be done, but he muſt know him, and believe him, therefore his knowledge muſt needs be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual before his fall.</p>
               <p>We come now to the next point, he endeavours to prove that infants by the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> are not heires of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. We need not in this matter be careful to give him an anſwer.</p>
               <p>If it be a queſtion <hi>de jure,</hi> we ſay the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> is ſuch, and Original ſin in its own nature is ſuch, that it doth deſerve dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: But if it be a queſtion <hi>de facto,</hi> there is no ſuch need that we ſhould poſſitively affirme the actual damnation of infants. They that be ſaved, we may ſafely affirme are ſaved by the mercy of God; and they that are damned, God can cleare his juſtice in their condemnation: though in all things the reaſon of his proceeding is not ſo intelligible to us. And our Author himſelfe, I beleeve, when he hath well pondred the buſineſſe, will finde it to be more ſafe to reſt in ſuch a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. But as for his arguments, they are fallacious in many particulars: For moſt of them I have anſwered in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the treatiſe; And for the reſidue I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak of them afterwards. Here only foure things are to be noted in the general.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:168516:96"/>
               <p> Firſt, by the ſame reaſons as he doth overturne damnation by the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> any Jew or Turk may overthrow ſalvation by the merit of Chriſt. For why may not ſuch a one argue the death of Chriſt was an act of his, and none of ours, he ſuffered many hundred yeares ago? What he did, we cannot be ſaid to do, either vertually, or interpretively, in him or by him, we had no being at all, that our wills ſhould be contained in his.</p>
               <p>His ſufferings were without any knowledge, and conſent of ours, and wherefore ſhould any benefit ariſe to us? If there be any ſuch thing, why ſhould it ſo many ages together be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the greateſt part of mankind? Moſt of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do go after this way, and by the ſame reaſons that he takes away the guilt of ſin by the diſobedience of the firſt man, by the ſame he doth deſtroy all poſſibility of ſalvation by the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Secondly, other of his reaſons do go too far in queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the abſolute power, juſtice, and ſovereignty of God. As he would have men to be temperate in ſuch ſpeeches that ſeem to condemn infants to hell for the fault of another, ſo he alſo ſhould be more moderate in thoſe ſayings, that queſtion the power and the juſtice of God. What is, or what ſhall be the whole courſe of the Lords proceeding againſt infants that dye in original ſin, is variouſly diſputed: ſome ſpeak of a <hi>Limbus infantum,</hi> whither thoſe infants go that dye without baptiſme: Others ſpeak of the penalty of loſſe, without a penalty of ſenſe: A third ſort dreame of I know not what common receptacle, where infants as well as the ſouls of others do ſtill remaine in expectation of the reſurrection. But ſure I am, none do ſpeak more dangerouſly and deſperately, than they that except againſt the juſtice and the mercy of God, now in this our Author is too bold.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in all his reaſons, he goes againſt that which he teacheth elſewhere. For in ſundry places he ſheweth, that <hi>without the infuſion of ſupernatural grace, no man, neither infant nor other, can enter into the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> Againe (he ſaith) <hi>that by the fall of</hi> Adam <hi>mankind came to be divested and diſrobed of thoſe ſupernatural excellencies that formerly he had.</hi> Now by the poſition of theſe two, I leave it to any man to judge,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:168516:96"/>infants, as now borne in their natural condition, whether are they capable of ſalvation? whatſoever he may ſay in words, he and we as to this point may agree in the ſame principles. But in his anſwer to the Biſhops letter, he ſeems to be of opinion, that infants went neither to heaven nor hell, at leaſt ſuch a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection may be drawn from his words. <hi>Juſt ſo it is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in infants: Hell was not made for man, but for devils, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be ſomething beſides meere nature that must beare any man thither: meer nature neither goes to heaven nor hell,</hi> pag. 17. In which words of his we acknowledge it to be true in a ſenſe, that meer nature doth not carry a man to heaven or hell, for that which is not true at all, cannot carry a man any whither. The Sophiſters do indeed ſpeak of the creation of man, in <hi>puris naturalibus,</hi> in his pure naturals, but I no where finde that God did ever make, or did intend to make any man in ſuch eſtate that was neither good nor evil, I know no ſuch meer nature to be found in any part of the habitable earth; and therefore it is ſome way a truth (in this abſtract conſideration) that a pure nature carries a man no whether. But he hath another meaning in which he is greatly miſtaken, for under that notion and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as infants are now borne, this nature depraved carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only to hell. We were by <hi>nature the children of wrath as well as others,</hi> Eph. 2.2, 3. But here perhaps he will except by ſuch a tenet as this, all infants will be neceſſitated to damnation. Not ſo neither: they will be borne only in a nature lyable to damnation. But by our doctrine, we do not ſay that they muſt be all damned. I ſee nothing to the contrary, but Chriſt is as well able to ſave them from the pollution and corruption of the natural birth, as well as if they were all reduced to that imaginary ſtate that he ſpeaks of. Concerning this matter, he delivers his judgement in his anſwer to the Biſhops letter. <hi>When I affirme that infants, being by</hi> Adam <hi>reduced and left to their meer natural eſtate, fall ſhort of heaven, I do not ſay they cannot go to heaven at all, but they cannot go thither by their natural powers, they cannot without a new grace and favour go to heaven: But then it cannot preſently be inferred that therefore they go to hell, but this ought to be inferred, which indeed was the real conſequent of it, therefore it is neceſſary that Gods grace ſhould ſupply this defect if
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:168516:97"/>God intends heaven to them at all, and becauſe nature cannot, God ſent a Saviour by whom it was effected:</hi> ſo far he, <hi>pag.</hi> 15. Now I leave it to any man to judge, whither the ſame <hi>mutatis mutandis</hi> may not be ſaid of our opinion, though infants are borne in Original ſin, and are by nature the children of wrath, yet they may be ſaved by grace. By all this it is evident, that we are as faire for the ſalvation of infants as he is, and by the ſame doore as he goes out, we will go out at the ſame.</p>
               <p>And for the ſayings of our writers, I have three things to anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſome ſpeak more mildly in the point, rather inclining to the ſalvation, than the damnation of infants. <hi>Junius</hi> in his collation <hi>de naturâ &amp; gratiâ,</hi> hath theſe words: <hi>Nemo noſtrum it a fuerit aut furere compertus est, &amp;c. There is none of ours that is ſo mad, or was ever found ſo void of reaſon, who would ſimply affirme infants to be damned. They which teach otherwiſe, let themſelves look to it by what right they moy do it, and by what authority it may be done. For although in reſpect of their own ſelves, and that common nature of ours, they may be in a ſtate lyable to damnation; it follows not that we ſhould paſſe the ſentence of damnation upon them, &amp;c.</hi> In the proceſſe of his diſcourſe he giveth ſundry reaſons: Firſt, the promiſe of God to believers, and their natural ſeed. Secondly, his mercy to thouſands, and that through many deſcents, where the Anceſtors have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times belonged to the Covenant. Thirdly, The judgement of charity, ſeeing it is the Lords pleaſure to take them away in their infancy, we may preſume that by that fatherly act of his he intends to receive them to mercy. Other teſtimonies may be brought of ſuch that have gone in the milder way, but theſe ſhall ſuffice.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſort of our Expoſitiors there are that do pitch more hard. They ſay that ſome infants may go to hell, yet they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate their ſentence, as <hi>Chamier. Non abhorret a veriſimilitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine paenas eorum eſſe mitiſſimas, It is very probable their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are most mild.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third ſort leave the matter wholly in ſuſpence; they think it ſufficient to believe that all infants are borne in a ſtate lyable to damnation; they have in them the ſeeds of all evil, yet for
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:168516:97"/>all this they conceive that God may ſhew mercy in and through Chriſt, ſpecially to the infants of ſuch that do belong to the Covenant, ſpecially where conſcience is made to enter them into the outward viſible Church by baptiſme. And this is all that we will ſay of this queſtion.</p>
               <p>Leaving this buſineſſe of the ſtate of infants, and reſerving to God the ſecrets of election or non-election, we will come to the point that is more uſeful and more eaſie to be underſtood. And here he queſtions, <hi>whether Adam did debauch our nature, and corrupt our will and manner by his fall?</hi> And if he did it, he further enquires after the manner how it was done? Firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was done by a natural or phyſical efficiency of ſin it ſelfe? Secondly, whether was it becauſe we are all in the loynes of <hi>Adam?</hi> or, Thirdly, whether was the ſentence and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God the cauſe thereof? he hath foure arguments againſt a phyſical efficiency, which we have in part handled already, and ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak afterwards. And therefore to avoid repetition we will come to the ſecond branch, whether <hi>Adam</hi> did debauch our nature, becauſe we are all in his loynes. Againſt this he hath ſundry reaſons that follow in order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the ſame reaſon</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we are guilty of all the ſins that he committed while we were in his loynes, there being no imaginable reaſon why the firſt ſhould be propagated, and not the reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As I have formerly ſhewed, ſo I declare againe, the pollution of nature can only be propagated from the firſt ſin, becauſe in that only <hi>Adam</hi> did act as a publick man, in which ſence the Apoſtle calls him, the figure of him that is to come. But of this I have ſpoken already.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, upon this account</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all the ſins of all our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitours will be imputed to us, becauſe we were in their loynes when they ſinn'd them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not ſo neither, for though we were in their loynes when they ſinned, yet in a ſtrict ſence they are only <hi>vehicula,</hi> ſo many conduit pipes of the conveyances of the nature from the firſt root. To ſpeak properly, there are only two roots of the nature: <hi>Adam</hi> the root of corruption to all his branches, Chriſt the root of grace and ſpiritual life to all his branches. If
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:168516:98"/>any queſtion be made of the truth of this, there is every where in the doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> an antitheſis between the fleſh and the ſpirit, between the old man and the new, betwixt generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and regeneration, betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt. Between theſe two there is a plaine oppoſition in three things in point of juſtification. Secondly, in point of ſanctification. Thirdly, in point of the reſurrection from the dead. And therefore, whereas the firſt man by his act brings us under the guilt of ſin, the ſecond waſhes away the guilt of ſin by his blood: and whereas the firſt man pollutes our nature, and is the root of the corruption of nature; the ſecond man ſanctifies our nature, and is the root of a new nature to all his branches: And whereas the firſt man did bring in death, and all the miſeries of nature upon our bodies that lead to death, the ſecond man frees us from all theſe by the reſurrection from the dead. But he further alledgeth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Sin (ſaith he) is ſeated, <hi>in the will it is an action, and ſo tranſient, and when it dwels or abides, it abides no where but in the will by approbation and love, to which is naturally conſequent a readineſſe in the inferiour faculties to obey and act accordingly, and therefore ſin doth not infect our meer natural faculties, but the will only, and not that in the natural capacity, but in its moral only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though it be true that ſin is principally ſeated in the will, yet we ſhall finde all along, that the Scriptures do lay great weight upon the blindneſſe and the perverſity of the judgement; and as in the old creation, ſo it is in the new. The firſt work that is done is the creation of light: Beſides the Chriſt-like diſpoſition is begun and carried on by degrees, and all this by the renovation of light. The underſtanding is firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, and then the will comes to chooſe the things of God. Further, let it be ſuppoſed, that ſin is only ſeated in the will. Great difference is to be made between the will of other ſinners, and the will of the firſt man. The will of other ſinners doth only <hi>redundare in perſonam,</hi> it doth encreaſe the habit of ſin in their own perſons alone: the will of the firſt man did <hi>redundare in naturam,</hi> it did vitiate and deprave the whole nature as we have formerly ſhewed. And yet thirdly, whereas he ſaith, <hi>that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:168516:98"/>ſin doth infect the will, not in its natural capacity, but in its moral only.</hi> This expreſſion of his muſt (under favour) be taken with a graine of ſalt. We do willingly yield, that the will is moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or rather ſpiritually corrupt becauſe ſhe wents that holineſſe, that purity and righteouſneſſe which the law requires; yet if we look to the reaſons of things, the corruption was brought into the will by the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> They then do not ſpeak im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, that call the corruption of the will <hi>pravitatem phyſico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralem.</hi> It is a moral depravation, becauſe it is againſt the rectitude of the moral law: it is a natural depravation, becauſe it flows from the firſt man as the root of corruption. For the proofe of the latter, let us have recourſe to that place of the Apoſtle, <hi>ye have put off the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new man.</hi> In theſe words of his, there is a direct oppoſition between the old man and the new. By the old man he meaneth the pravity and corruption of nature, which though it hath had its being in hundreds, thouſands, and millions of men, yet originally all comes out of one root. In this regard the whole nature is called by the title of the old man. So proportionably the Chriſt-like diſpoſition, though it hath been diffuſed into infinite perſons, who have lived in ſeveral ages of the Church, yet the whole nature doth originally proceed out of one root, and therefore in this regard is elegantly called by the title of the new man. Secondly, the oppoſition is between <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>their being uncloathed,</hi> and their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>their being cloathed upon.</hi> By this way of expreſſion the Apoſtle doth inſinuate, the corrupt diſpoſition of the fleſh is that which the ſoul is cloathed upon, which cloathing ſhe had from <hi>Adam</hi> the root of corruption. Now the believing <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> becauſe they had a living principal within, and had begun to put off, and did ſo continue in putting off the old man, he ſpeaks of it as a work already done, <hi>ye have put off the old man with his deeds.</hi> So likewiſe the new nature, or the Chriſt-like diſpoſition is here reſembled to a garment, with which they were cloathed upon, becauſe they had begun and did ſo continue to put it on by degrees, he doth ſpeak of it as a matter already effected, <hi>ye have put on the new man.</hi> From all which we gather the pravity of the will, though it be in its own nature a moral, or rather
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:168516:99"/>ſpiritual obliquity. Yet reſpecting the cauſe, it proceeds from <hi>Adam</hi> the root of corruption. If this truth be not admitted, we ſhall croſſe and hinder the very chief deſigne of the Goſpel: For the corruption of nature being laid in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> it doth caſt us all upon the ſeeking, longing, deſiring the new nature that is to be had from the ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to him that conſiders it, it will ſeem ſtrange and monſtrous, that a moral obliquity in a ſingle inſtance, ſhould make an univerſal change in a natural ſuſcipient, and in a natural capacity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is no more ſtrange then true: we ſay that <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience was a moral obliquity, and he by that ſingle act of his, did cauſe an univerſal change in the whole nature of man: By it the ſouls of men come to be cloathed upon with the habit of ſin, and their bodies with corruption. And if he or any man elſe ſhall marvel at this, they muſt upon this account wonder at the chiefe foundations of the Goſpel. For we will not doubt to ſay in the parallel caſe, as the Lord Chriſt did humble himſelfe to the death of the croſſe, it was <hi>in genere mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> a moral obedience, he did obey the command of his Father. Yet by this one act of his, he did make a change, not only in a moral, but alſo in a natural ſuſcipient he did a thing by, and through which the ſouls of the Saints may be freed from inward pravity, and corruption, and their bodies raiſed from the dead at the laſt day, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He reaſons, <hi>no man can tranſmit a good habit, a grace, or a virtue. By natural generation, as a great Scholars ſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be borne with learning, &amp;c. and how can it be, that a naughty quality ſhould be more apt to be diſſeminated than a good one, when it is not in the goodneſſe, or badneſſe of the quality that hinders his diſſemination, but its being an acquired, and ſuperinduced quality that makes it cannot naturally deſcend?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We willingly yield, that a good quality is as apt to be diſſeminated as a bad: and therefore had <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood, he had diſſeminated the image of God, to the poſterity that did come of him. But ſeeing that he fell by his fall, he doth now diſſeminate Original corruption to all his branches. Further, though <hi>Adam</hi> doth diſſeminate corruption by natural genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:168516:99"/>mankind is not left under an abſolute neceſſity of periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as long as a ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is prepared to diſſeminate grace and ſpiritual life by regeneration, Excellent is that ſpeech of <hi>Hillary</hi> upon the fourty eighth Pſalm. <hi>Quoniam animarum medicus non venit vocare juſtos, &amp;c. Becauſe the Phyſitian of ſouls came not to call the just, but ſinners to repentance: therefore he ordained, that whatſoever was worſt in every company, ſhould be ſooneſt called. Of all men living upon the earth, the heathen were the worſt, yet they were the ſooneſt called.</hi> Further, whereas our Author ſaith, that a great <hi>Schollars ſon cannot be borne with learning, and the child of a Judge cannot upon his birth-day give wiſe ſentences;</hi> the reaſon is plaine, perſonal priviledges and acquired habits do not naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend. But with the two <hi>Adams</hi> the caſe is far otherwiſe, for they have a nature to communicate to all their branches. The firſt doth communicate it by generation, the ſecond by regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as we have formerly proved. And whereas he argues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How can a quality morally bad, be directly and regularly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by an action morally good, and ſince that, neither God that is the Maker of all, doth amiſſe, and the Father that begets, ſins not, and the child that is begotten cannot ſin, by what conveyance can any poſitive evil be derived to posterity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this we ſay that the body and the ſoul are both the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of God, yet both may be made the ſubject, and the ſeat of ſin, through the temptation of Sathan, and a vitious propagation. Neither is the evil any way to be aſcribed to the Creatour, but to the temptation of Sathan, and the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the firſt man. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaks to good purpoſe, <hi>Sic ego tibi rectiſſime dico malum cum quo naſcitur homo, &amp;c. Thus I do moſt rightly ſay to thee, that the evil with which a man is borne, is not of the fruits, bodies, ſexes, conjunctions, of which goods the Lord is the Author, but of the firſt ſin which is to be aſcribed to the devil.</hi> Here he doth diſtinguiſh between the work of creation, and ſo God is the Author of all that good that was made in the beginning: and the ſinfulneſſe of nature; that he will have to ſpring only from the devils temptation, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of the firſt man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly, how can it be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Father that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes nothing to the production of the ſoul, ſhould contribute to her
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:168516:100"/>pollution, and he that did not tranſmit life, how ſhould he tranſmit his ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though the Father doth not contribute to the ſoul in her production, yet he doth contribute to the ſoul in her union with the body: So by this account, the action of God is terminated in the ſimple being of the ſoul: The action of the Parent is her being in the body, that is, in her union with the body. But if it be here alledged, that a man is principally a man in reſpect of his ſoul, and therefore if the Parent doth not contribute to the ſoul, he doth not contribute to the being of a man: the anſwer is plaine. A man is not a man, neither by the ſoul apart, nor by the body apart, but by the whole humane nature which doth conſiſt in the union of both: we ſee in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary experience, as children derive their inheritances, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, nobility, and ſuch like from their Parents, ſo alſo their Parents miſeries, infelicities, poverty, and ignobility do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſcend. In the preſent caſe I demand, how do they deſcend? will any man be ſo curious to hold a diſpute, whether they do deſcend from the body, or the ſoul of the Parent? Or whether is the ſoul the firſt ſeat, or receptacle of nobility, or ignobility? or doth the right to the fathers inheritance deſcend from the fathers body or the ſoul? In the affaires of this life, it is not uſual with men to ſpin out themſelves with ſuch philoſophical niceties. The skilful in the laws, conceive it is enough in the general to ſay, that ſuch a Son did come out of the loynes of ſuch a Father. Why then ſhould the learned man, with whom we have to do, be more curious in the conveyance of original ſin? why ſhould it not be enough for us to ſay, that that which is borne of fleſh, is fleſh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. Suppoſe, for the manner of the thing we are not able to ſatisfie the doubt, ſhall we deny the thing, becauſe we are not able to explaine every punctilio? why, by the ſame reaſon doth not he himſelfe deny the motion of the Sun, the ebbing and the flowing of the ſea, the organizing of the infant in the mothers womb? in theſe and a thouſand more the thing is cleare, when the manner doth lye in the dark.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, ſaith he, <hi>If in him we ſinned, then it were juſt that in him we ſhould be puniſhed, for as the ſin is, ſo ought the puniſhment to be.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:168516:100"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If he will ſtand to this rule, he both doth, and will make good that which is aſſerted by us. The diſobedience of the firſt man muſt be imputed to all his poſterity, becauſe he is the head, the root and the repreſentative of the whole nature. But if he thinks this to be a meer <hi>non-ens,</hi> then let him ſay, that the obedience of the ſecond man as the head-root, and the repreſentative of the whole nature, is a <hi>non-ens</hi> and a nullity alſo, and ſo he will raiſe the Goſpel to the foundation thereof.</p>
               <p>Now we come to the third queſtion to enquire, whether <hi>Adam</hi> did debauch our nature by the ſentence and the juſt judgement of God, and here he layeth down this for a ſure ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He and all his posterity were left in the meer natural eſtate, that is, in a ſtate of imperfection, in a ſtate that was not ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and furniſhed with ability in order to a ſupernatural end, whether God had ſecretly deſigned mankind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this expreſſion of his, we know no ſuch ſtate of meer imperfection, which is not alſo a ſtate of corruption. Againe, in this expreſſion he ſeemeth to me, to pluck down that natural ability of the will which he endeavours to ſet up. For if a man ſince the fall is not inſtructed and furniſhed with abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in order to a ſupernatural end, he muſt come to Chriſt only for the ſupply of all. Why then doth he raiſe all this duſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rigour and ſeverity of our doctrine, when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth here plainly teach, that the will can do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of the Spirit? He goeth on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be ſuppoſed,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that God did inflict any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſinning upon</hi> Adam <hi>or his poſterity, becauſe from that time, even unto this day, he by new laws had required innocency of life, or repentance and holineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The conſequence is not good, for now ſince the fall, the Lord doth not give laws in proportion to natural ability, but in relation to his own word of promiſe, and his free mercy in the Covenant of grace. So far then it is a teſtimony of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour that God will employ us, and require more ſervice of us, that where we have no ſtrength of our own, we may in the ſence of our own natural weakneſſe go to him for help. And
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:168516:101"/>whereas he bringeth us ſpeaking in this wiſe: that it is juſt with God to exact the law of man, even where he is unable to keep it, becauſe God once made him able, but he diſabled himſelfe: True indeed, this is an anſwer given by us, but it is not the whole, nor the principal part of that anſwer which may be given. For ſecondly, where God doth require ſubjection to his law, man being not able to performe it, his demand is not irrational; For though man is not ſubject, nor in himſelfe can be ſubject to the law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. This non-ſubjection doth not ſo much ariſe from the want of judgement, will, or any other natural faculty, as from a perverſe ſinful habit that doth reſide in the faculty. That a drunkard cannot ſtand, walk, nor performe acts of reaſon, as an other man is not ſimply for want of ability, as from an evil diſtemper that doth ſuſpend the operations of the faculties, ſo it is in the preſent caſe, men need no new faculties, but they need new habits to ſet the faculty aright. But our third anſwer is, though a man naturally can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſubject to the law, (reſpecting the evil habit that diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the faculty) yet if he go to Chriſt in the ſence of his own miſery, all ability is to be had from him: God is ſo infinitely gracious, that he is ready to help all that come to him. <hi>A bruiſed reed he will not break,</hi> Mat. 12.20. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden,</hi> Mat. 11.28. <hi>Will not your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father give his Spirit to them that ask it?</hi> Luk. 11.13. and many more places of the like nature: This is the whole anſwer which our Divines do commonly give, when they ſpeak of the neceſſity of ſinning, and of the inability which is brought upon man by the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> In this caſe they do not ſimply and abſolutely deny all abilitie, for then of what uſe would exhortations, reproofes, and commands be? Only they deny a natural ability, and ſuch an ability which our Author ſeems to plead for. Next he tells us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is all one with the caſe of voluntary and affected ignorance. He that refuſeth knowledge, leſt he ſhould understand his duty, and he that diſables himſelfe that he may not do it may be puniſht, not only for not doing it, but for making it impoſſible to be done. But that was not</hi> Adams <hi>caſe ſo far as we know, &amp; it is certaine that it was not ours in the matter of his ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:168516:101"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We confeſſe, that we did neither perſonally nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividually diſable our ſelves in the matter of his ſinne, but he that ſtood in our ſtead, did voluntarily diſable himſelf and us too. And therefore his will doth interpretively, virtually, and potentially go for the will of the whole nature, as we have formerly proved. Perhaps he will ſay, how can we be juſtly puniſhed, if we are diſabled by the act of another? This would have ſome colour, provided, that there were no Chriſt, no grace, no mercy to be had. Our great fault is, that we do not ſeek for help, where help is to be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>If a man commits a fault, that doth accidentally diſable him, as if he eate too much, and be ſick the next day, and fall into a fever, he may indeed, and is justly puniſhed for his gluttony, but he is not puniſhable for omitting that which in his preſent weakneſſe he can no way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here he ſpeaks, as if we did leave men to ſtrive with an unavoidable neceſſity, whereas the neceſſity of ſinning is not abſolute, for that which is unavoidable by nature, may be avoidable by grace. And to the particular caſe, ſuppoſe a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinal drink too much, and through his default a great party of the Army come to have their throats cut, will he ſay that he is onely to be puniſhed for his drunkenneſſe, but is not puniſhable for the omitting of that which in his preſent weakneſſe, he was not able to performe. By the laws of the land he ſhould onely pay five ſhillings, Next he ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In lawes to be impoſed afterwards, the caſe is otherwiſe becauſe the perſons are not capable of any ſuch law, and God knowing they cannot performe, cannot intend they ſhould, and therefore cannot juſtly puniſh them for not doing, which himſelfe did never heartily intend they ſhould do, becauſe he knew they could not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If this be ſo, let him give a reaſon why the old world was drowned in the waters of the flood. All fleſh had corrupted their way, and if he himſelf may beleived, the reaſon was not ſo much from the corruption of nature, but becauſe Gods laws did command ſuch things which were a reſtraint to the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and otherwiſe lawful inclinations of nature. Beſides he
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:168516:102"/>tells us that they had no ſpiritual promiſes in thoſe times. The commands were heightned above all natural abilities, ſpiritual promiſes were denyed; God never intended (if he ſpeak true) that his Laws ſhould be obeyed; he knew they could not. Let him fairly tell us the reaſon then why the old world was drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Now on the contrary, we ſay, no ſuch thing, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in proportion to the abilities he had in poſſeſſion, he falling, all ability is to be had from Chriſt in the covenant of grace. And there was a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace ſutable to the times that were before the flood, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt yeſterday, and today, and the ſame for ever,</hi> Heb. 13.8.</p>
               <p>But now in the cloſe of this Section, we will ſpeak a little practically to the purpoſe in hand. You will ſay, why doth God give commands above natural ability? It is to this end, that in the ſenſe of their own emptineſſe men ſhould go to Chriſt, when they ſo come, they ſhall be graciouſly received. You will ſay, how doth that appear? I anſwer. As by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral tenders of the Word, ſo ſpecially by that place, <hi>Ho, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye buy and eat, yea, come by wine and milk without money and without price,</hi> Iſaiah 55.1. Here many things are to be obſerved; Firſt, by wine and milk are underſtood the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual comforts and excellencies of the Goſpel, for as wine and milk are truely refreſhing to the bodies of men; So are theſe really ſweet to their ſpiritual taſte. Secondly, by buying of wine and milk, is meant, the earneſt ſeeking after theſe things in all thoſe wayes that the Lord hath ſanctified, and in all thoſe means where they may be found. Thirdly, without money or price. It would be thought a ſoleciſme in merchandizing, to buy a Cow and Horſe, and a parcel of Sheep, and give no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for them. Uſually men buy, when they give an equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent price. But in matter of ſalvation, we have no ability of our own, all ability is to be had from the freeneſſe and fulneſs of the promiſe. Fourthly, the perſons invited. Ho, every one that thirſteth, come to the waters, &amp;c. In matters of the world, men may have a great deſire after riches, long life, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, favour of Princes, popular applauſe, and yet they may
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:168516:102"/>never attain what they deſire, nay, the thing deſired (as their own ſhadow) may flee from them. But in matters of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the caſe is otherwiſe. If men truly deſire, and continue deſiring, praying, longing, waiting, they cannot miſſe what they deſire. The greateſt part of the work is done already, and all the reſidue doth remain upon the fidelity, and the truth of the Promiſer to make good. Laſtly, it is ſpoken to every one that thirſteth. There are divers degrees and kinds of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual thirſting, ſome that are ſcorched with the feeling of the wrath of God, earneſtly deſire ſalvation and remiſſion of ſinne by Chriſts blood, and theſe commonly are the firſt deſires of thoſe that are babes in Chriſt. Others, feeling the bondage of corruption, do as earneſtly long for that ſpiritual freedome that is to be had from the Son. A third ſort go higher, they deſire the excellency of Chriſt purely, for that excellency that is in himſelf; they do not love him ſo much for his portion, as for his perſon. <hi>I count all things but loſſe, for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord,</hi> Phil. 3.8. A fourth ſort go to the higheſt point. They love the appearing of the Lord Jeſus, which others do tremble at, and <hi>the Spirit and the Bride ſay, come, and let him that heareth ſay, come, and let him that is athirſt come,</hi> Revel. 22 17. &amp;c. All theſe deſires are the fruit of the Spirit. He that comes to the firſt, doth not come to the ſecond, at leaſt not to the third or fourth degree. However the whole courſe of Chriſtianity is <hi>unum continuum ſitis,</hi> one continual ſucceſſion of ſpiritual deſires. And in immediate op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, there is <hi>unum continuum auxilii,</hi> an interchangable ſupply of auxiliary grace, this latter anſwering the former, as the one part of the deed doth anſwer the other. So then, though the Saints have no ability in themſelves to ſupernatural duties, yet they may have it from Chriſt and the freeneſſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Theſe things I have drawn out more at large, becauſe I ſee, as formerly, it hath done to others; So our doctrine doth ſeem to give great offence to our Authour. It ſeemeth ſtrange to him that we ſhould exhort men to ſpiritual duties, and yet teach that all mankind through the condition of the natural birth, lye under a neceſſity of ſinning. Whereas, if he did well underſtand the grand deſigne of the Goſpel, he ſhould finde
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:168516:103"/>that all ability to do theſe things, is to be had from Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and that upon termes of beleeving, deſiring, longing, and waiting for them. The Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, and other holy men, have in their ſeveral times done their duties, and ſerved their generation. But how? not by any ability of their own, but by the continual ſupply of the Spirit of Chriſt, as the Scriptures and all experience do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teſtifie.</p>
               <p>Now we come to the next Section.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>
                  <hi>SECT. 2.</hi> Conſideration of the objections againſt the former Doctrine.</head>
               <p>THE firſt Scripture which he inſiſts upon, is, <hi>Gen</hi> 6. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very imagination of the thoughts of mans heart are onely evil continually.</hi> Here he doth end avour to frame ſundry anſwers,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, it is true</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they were ſo, but it was their own fault, not Adams; for ſo it is ſaid expreſſely. All fleſh had corrupted their way upon earth, and the earth was filled with violence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> It was their own fault, and <hi>Adams</hi> too. It was their own, as they corrupted their own wayes, it was <hi>Adams</hi> as they were fleſh, for he brought them into that ſinful condition by his fall. So then the force of our argument ſtands thus. Firſt, the thoughts of man were evil. Secondly, they were all evil. Thirdly, they were onely evil. Fourthly, they were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally evil. Fifthly, they were evil from his childhood. Now ſuch an univerſal effect cannot be without ſome univerſal cauſe from whence all this evil muſt neceſſarily ſpring. And where ſhall we look for the cauſe, but in the text it ſelf; <hi>My Spirit ſhall not alway ſtrive with man, becauſe he is but fleſh.</hi> Becauſe he is but fleſh, and borne in the ſinne of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, therefore the thoughts of his heart are evil from his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:168516:103"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if this corruption had been natural and unavoidable, why did God puniſh all the world for it, except eight perſons? Why did he puniſh thoſe that could not help it? and why did others eſcape that were equally guilty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> That which God did puniſh in the old world in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary men, was the violence of their hands, and in his own people was the breach of covenant. Though theſe two did naturally flow from original corruption, as all other evils do, yet we cannot ſay, that they are abſolutely unavoidable; for the act of violence and of marriage with the daughter of a ſtrange god, men have a liberty to forbeare the outward exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of theſe evils. And for the luſt of the heart, though it is unavoidable by nature, yet it is not ſimply unavoidable, for God is ſo full of mercy, that he is ready to help all thoſe that flee to him, in the ſenſe of their own miſery. He hath declared himſelf to be a Phyſician, ready to cure all broken-hearted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The men of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> did turne from the violence of their hands, and how ready was he to forgive them. The people in the dayes of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did repent of their Idolatrous marriages, and how did he paſſe by their iniquity? Of all the Authors that ever I met with, <hi>Luther</hi> in his Tract <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervo arbitrio,</hi> is moſt ſevere againſt the liberty of the will; yet in the end of the treatiſe, he bringeth in <hi>Eraſmus</hi> thus ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Why doth <hi>he command us any duty, ſeeing all things are done by neceſſity?</hi> His anſwer is, <hi>he doth command that he may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh and inſtruct us what we ought to do, that being humbled in the ſenſe and feeling of our own evil, we may repair to his grace for help, as we have abundantly ſpoken.</hi> And as for the Lords pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of thoſe that could not help it. We ſay in publick, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and exemplary judgments he hath alway reſerved a liberty for the exemple of others, and the declaration of his juſtice and mercy. It is true alſo that they that were equally guilty did not periſh in the waters of the flood. What of all this? though they did eſcape that judgment, they were lyable to the judgment of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God might have as well puniſhed all the world for ſleeping once in a day, or for being
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:168516:104"/>hungry, as for ſinning, if ſo to do, be natural and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> The caſes are not equal, mankind cannot live without meat and drink, ſleep and ſuch other refections of nature, when they were made in the beginning, they were made in ſuch an eſtate, that they had need of theſe things, I trow they had no need of ſinne? Againe, for ſinful acts, though they come from the corruption of the fleſh, as the ſparkes do out of the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, yet in externals, man hath a liberty to commit or not commit ſuch an evil. Alſo for the luſt of the heart, that which is unavoidable by nature, is avoidable by grace. The guilt of ſinne may be taken away by the blood of Chriſt, the power of it by the Spirit of Chriſt; and the very being of it, when the Saints ſhall be made partakers of the adoption or the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their bodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, if God in theſe words complained of their natural and original corruption, why did he but then as if it were, a new thing, complain of it, and repent that he made man ſince he proved ſo bad?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> God did then complain of original corruption, becauſe in a moſt eminent degree it did put forth it ſelf in oppreſſion, breach of covenant, and other evils. He did complain in thoſe times, becauſe iniquity was then come to a ripeneſſe, and the years of his patience was almoſt runne out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this malice and corruption was ſuch, that God did ſend Noah a Preacher of righteouſneſſe, to draw the world from it. But no man ſuppoſes that it was fit to ſend a Preacher to dehort them from being guilty of original ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> So farre as we may gather, <hi>Noahs</hi> meſſage to the old world was the ſame in effect, as that of <hi>Jonah's</hi> to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> he was to exhort them to turn from the violence of their hands, as being one fruit of original ſinne. Moreover, he was ſent to admoniſh the people of God in thoſe dayes of their ſinful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies and marriages with Idolaters; and whereas he ſaith, <hi>no man ſuppoſeth it fit to ſend a Preacher to dehort men from being guilty of original ſinne.</hi> Though the beſt as long as they live here, are ſubject to that ſinne, yet I hope he will allow that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:168516:104"/>a Preacher may be ſent to exhort men to mortifie the luſts of their nature, and to fly to the mercy of God for the pardon and forgiveneſſe of that ſinne, as well as others. What the Economy or diſpenſation of grace was in thoſe times. I will not take upon me to define, ſure I am the Lord himſelf ſaith, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not alway strive with man.</hi> The beſt Scholars, according to the original, have it, My Spirit ſhall not alway di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute reaſon, or plead with man. It argues then that as the Spirit was in the Miniſtry of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo it was ſome way operative in the conſciences of the people of thoſe times to bring them to repentance. Compare with this, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, <hi>&amp;</hi> 20. Now he comes to lay the blame of all upon evil-cuſtome, which is the very height of Pelagianiſme. <hi>Blame not nature,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but thy own evil customes; for the neglect of thy fields will make fearne, and thiſtles to grow. It is not onely becauſe the ground is accurſt, but becauſe it is neglected it bears thornes. Thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived if thou thinkeſt that vices are born with us. No, they are ſuper-induced, and come upon us afterward.</hi> To which we reply, Theſe ſtrange expreſſions he hath not from any of the Prophets or Apoſtles, but from <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Seneca.</hi> As theſe things are ſcarcely tolerable in them, ſo they are not to be born with in our Authour, and others which have had their being and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Church of God. Becauſe in theſe dayes, there are more then too many which cannot diſtinguiſh between E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks and Divinity, between that which is moral, and that which is ſpiritual; we will inſiſt upon this point a little more largely.</p>
               <p>The chief principals and foundation of moral Philoſophy, are ſuch as theſe. Firſt, that nature is pure. Secondly, that nature hath the ſeed of all vertue. Thirdly, there is a natural freedom of the will. Fourthly, by the repitition of many vertuous acts men come to the habit of vertue; Theſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch like rules there are in the treatiſes of the learned Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Romans. And according to this ſenſe the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſayings of <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> are to be underſtood. We deny not but toward the attaining of a Philoſophical good, a man hath ſome power (by general aſſiſtance) he may do ſome duties of the firſt and ſecond table. He may containe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:168516:105"/>his hands from the outward acts of murder, adultery, theft, and the like.</p>
               <p>But for the ſpiritual and theological good, to love God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, to delight in him, to beleeve in him, to truſt in him. In order to theſe, plaine experience ſheweth that he hath no ability, nay, the contrary is evident, that he hath a down-right enmity. The wiſdome of his fleſh is alwayes prone to reare up ſome earthly excellency or other, and to ſet it in the place of the true God. Therefore theſe are the true principles of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology. Firſt, the nature of man is depraved from the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the natural birth. Secondly, that he hath no freedome to ſpiritual good. Thirdly, in this miſerable eſtate, the firſt ſtep to his recovery, is by the reproving work of the Spirit, whoſe office it is to convince the conſcience of the guilt of ſin, and of the bondage of corruption. Fourthly, the conſcience being ſo convinced, it is prepared and fitted for the grace of the Goſpel, and the freeneſſe of the promiſe, that he which hath no help in himſelf, may have it from Chriſt. Fifthly, When he is come to Chriſt, and united to him by faith, he hath ability from him, as a root of all grace, life, heating ſpiritual nature, and in a word, all that we have loſt in the firſt man, is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in him. This is the very ſcope the Goſpel. By theſe things it is evident, that the endeavour of man is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the principles of Theology; Onely he is more ſoundly directed to the attaining of that good which is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. There be many paſſages in moral Philoſophy concerning the liberty of the will, which we may well admit of; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, others there are which will ſcarce hold water. As in the young man in the Goſpel, our Saviour did not diſallow his outward moralities, onely he convinced him that he fell ſhort of the holineſſe, purity and ſpirituality of the Law. When he was put upon it to love God above all, to leave all for him, by this he was brought to underſtand his own imperfection, and that he had need of ſome power from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
               <p>But that this matter may be the more fully underſtood, we will referre our ſelves to that place of Scripture, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Saint <hi>Peters Ethicks.</hi> There we may diſtinguiſh
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:168516:105"/>between the Ethicks (as I may ſo ſay) of the Apoſtles, and thoſe of the ordinary moral Philoſophers. Theſe are his words, <hi>According as his divine power hath given us all things that pertaine to life and godlineſſe, by the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and vertue. Whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promiſes, that by theſe we may be made partakers of the divine nature, having eſcaped the pollution of the world through luſt. And beſides this, giving all diligence, adde to our ſaith ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and to vertue knowledge, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Peter Chap. 1. ver. 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>As in our ordinary books of moral Phyloſophy, ſo theſe words of the Apoſtle may conveniently be divided into two parts; into that which treateth of the divine nature and vertue in general, and into that which ſpeaketh of particular vertues: For the divine nature, theſe particulars are to be obſerved. Firſt, the Apoſtle calls it a nature, as there is a nature of Birds, Beaſts, and Fiſhes; ſo there is a nature peculiar to the Saints, which they have, and none elſe. Secondly, it is called the divine nature, though in a more peculiar ſence; Father Son and holy Ghoſt are ſaid to have the divine nature, yet in a more general acception, the new creature is ſaid to have the divine nature, becauſe he comes in the neareſt ſimilitude to the nature, purity, and holineſſe of God, becauſe he derives it from Chriſt as the root of the nature. The Apoſtle hath a like expreſſion <hi>that ye may be filled with the fulneſſe of God,</hi> that is, with the fulneſſe of the grace, and the love of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18, 19. But the chief thing in the Apoſtles words, is, concerning the meanes how we may come to this nature. As in moral Phyloſophy, great regard is had to the natural liberty of the will, to the towardlineſſe of the diſpoſition, and too much exerciſe, by and through which men think to come to the habit of virtue: So on the contrary part, let us ſee what principles the Apoſtle doth lay down for the attaining of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and let us compare them with thoſe which our Author brings out of <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Seneca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, the Apoſtle points to the promiſes, <hi>there are given to us exceeding great and precious promiſes, that by theſe ye may be made partakers of the divine nature.</hi> What theſe promiſes are, we
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:168516:106"/>finde mentioned in the Scripture. <hi>I will put my law in their heart, and write it in their inward part,</hi> Jer. 31.33. <hi>A new heart, and a new spirit I will give them, I will take out of their bowels the heart of stone, and will give them a heart of fleſh,</hi> Ezek. 36.26. Theſe are called <hi>exceeding great</hi> promiſes, becauſe they containe the greateſt things, for what greater thing is there than to change the nature of a man. It is as great a work, as to bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to divide the ſea, and to make the ſun ſtand ſtill. They are called alſo honourable, or <hi>precious promiſes,</hi> to a ſpiritual underſtanding they are of an higher value than the greateſt treaſures of the earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the way to come to the divine nature, is not by the promiſes alone, but by faith in the promiſes. The Apoſtle doth direct his ſpeech, to ſuch that had obtained <hi>like precious faith with us,</hi> verſe the firſt. And againe, his divine power hath given us all things pertaining to life and godlineſſe. But how? not abſolutely, but through the knowledge of him, that is, through faith in him that hath called us to glory and vertue. And, as it is in another place, <hi>we are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation,</hi> 1 Peter 1.5. We are kept by the power of God to ſalvation, but through faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the way to come to the divine nature, is by the power of God; there can be no coming to the divine nature, but by the divine power: his divine power doth give us all things that doth pertaine to life and godlineſſe. So then the inward work doth proceed after this method. Firſt, the promiſe is freely made. Secondly, faith apprehendeth the promiſe. Thirdly, the promiſe being apprehended by ſaith, doth engage the power of God to performe that which is promiſed, and ſo the Saints come to be partakers of the divine nature.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the encreaſe of the nature is by mortification of luſts, having <hi>eſcaped the pollution of the world through luſt.</hi> If we ſpeak properly, it is neither profit, pleaſure, honour, or any thing elſe that can corrupt the ſoul, were it that ſhe were free in her ſelfe. Theſe are the particulars that concerne the divine nature, or the nature of vertue in general. The Apoſtle after this, ſpeaks of particular vertues, <hi>adde to your faith, vertue, and to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:168516:106"/>vertue, knowledge.</hi> By all theſe particulars we may diſcerne for the cheriſhing of endeavour, what little need we have to fly to the rudiments of heathen Philoſophy, to the purity of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural birth, and to ſuch like dictates of <hi>Seneca,</hi> and <hi>Horace.</hi> Theſe are the things which the Apoſtle doth admoniſh us. Beware leſt any man ſpoile you through Phyloſophy and vaine deceipt, after the rudiments of the world, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8. They that do this, do not hold Chriſt for a head, but do go directly againſt the principles of baptiſme and circumciſion, as all do that deny original ſin, and plead the purity of the natural birth, having gone ſo far, we will returne to our Author againe, as he expounds the words of the text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we may the better understand the following words, I will not againe curſe the ground for mans ſake, for the imagination of mans heart is evil from his child-hood,</hi> Gen. 8.21. <hi>Concerning which, note, that theſe words are not two ſentences. For this is not the reaſon wherefore God gave over ſmiting, for if it had been the reaſon, it would have come to paſſe, that the ſame cauſe that would have moved God to ſmite, would alſo move him to forbeare, which were a ſtrange Oeconomy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> There is no ſuch ſtrange Oeconomy in the words, if the ſcope of both texts be diligently conſidered. In the ſixth of <hi>Geneſis</hi> the Lord ſaith, that he would deſtroy the world, becauſe the thoughts of the imagination of mans heart are evil continually. Here we have a plaine reaſon given, why the world is deſtroyed, all fleſh had corrupted their wayes, and this corruption did ariſe from the common pravity of nature from the firſt root. But in the eighth of <hi>Geneſis</hi> the matter is otherwiſe. The Lord did not look ſo much to that which man had deſerved, as to the merit of the blood of Chriſt, figured in the ſacrifice of <hi>Noah.</hi> And therefore the words do beſt go after this tenour, <hi>I will not curſe the ground any more, although the thoughts of mans heart are evil from his childhood.</hi> And therefore we agree with our Author, that theſe words are an aggravation of the kindneſſe and mercy of God, as if he had ſaid, though men be continually evil, yet I will not for all that drown the world for mans being ſo evil. The former text doth ſhew what God might do, reſpect being had to his juſtice:
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:168516:107"/>The latter doth ſhew what he will do with reference to the merit of his Son, and his own mercy. Theſe things are no way contrary to our aſſertion. We come to the ſecond Scripture.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Theſe words are an Hebraiſme, and ſignify nothing, but an aggrandation of his ſinfulneſſe, and are intended for an high expreſſion, meaning that I am wholly, and entirely wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rely</hi> There are (I confeſſe) as in other Authors; ſo in the Scriptures, ſome ſuch formes, and wayes of expreſſion which are true in the figure, but falſe in the letter. But whether this expreſſion is of that nature, we cannot eaſily admit: For he prayeth that God <hi>would create in him a cleane heart.</hi> This plainly ſheweth, that the evil was in his heart from the very beginning. Beſides, other Scriptures do abundantly confirme the litteral interpretation of the words. <hi>That which is borne of fleſh is fleſh,</hi> Joh. 3.6. <hi>Borne, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God,</hi> Joh. 1.13. <hi>were by nature the children of wrath, as well as others,</hi> Eph. 2.3. All theſe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſe the impurity of the natural birth, and that the words of the Pſalmiſt are to be taken according to the letter. And that Scripture (which he ſeemeth to build ſo much upon) if it be well conſidered, doth not make for his purpoſe one jot. The like (ſaith he) is that ſaying of the Phariſees. <hi>Thou wert altogether borne in ſin, and doſt thou teach us,</hi> Joh. 9.35? <hi>Which phraſe and manner of ſpeaking, being plainly a reproach of the poore blind man, and a diſparagement of him, did meane only to call him a very wicked perſon: but not that he had derived his ſin origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and from his birth, for that had been their own caſe, as much as his. To all which we reply, the Phariſees might think him or his Parents to be ſome</hi> great ſinners, becauſe he was borne blind, for the diſciples themſelves did put ſuch a kinde of queſtion, to our Saviour himſelfe, <hi>did this man, or his parents ſin, that he was borne
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:168516:107"/>blinde? verſe the ſecond.</hi> Further, ſuppoſe that the Phariſees had been of the judgement, that it had been this mans peculiar infelicity; and that it was not the common miſery of man to be borne in original ſin, muſt their errour be a prejudice to the truth? <hi>Nicodemus</hi> himſelfe was darke in the point of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt his ignorance be a rule to us?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if</hi> David <hi>had meant it literally, it had not ſignified that himſelfe was borne in original ſin, but his Father, and his Mother ſinn'd when they begot him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> Its very rational to conceive, that his Father, that went for an old man in the dayes of <hi>Saul,</hi> and his Mother that bare him (ſpecially he being the youngeſt) were both dead, at the time of the making of the Pſalm. To what purpoſe ſhould he confeſſe the ſinne of the dead, and pray for the dead? But ſuppoſe he did confeſſe the ſin of his Parents, he muſt needs look upon them as the conduit-pipes, and the conveyances of the corruption of the nature from the firſt root. This doth ſtrengthen the truth of our interpretation; and therefore he doth devoutly, and pathetically pray, <hi>Create in me a cleane heart, renew within me a right ſpirit: waſh me with hyſop, and I ſhall be cleane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if it did relate to his own perſon, he might meane that he was begotten with that ſanguine diſpoſition, and libidinous temper that was the original of his vile adultery; and then, though</hi> David <hi>ſaid this truely of himſelfe, it is not true of all, nor of thoſe whoſe temper is flegmatick, and unactive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> By this rule we may gather, that the phlegmatick, and unactive (whatſoever the ſanguine be) are free from original ſinne; and that it doth not belong ſo much to Divines, as to Phyſicians to judge of the ſin of the nature. But in this, he is greatly deceived. <hi>David</hi> doth not confeſſe the ſinne of adultery alone, but the ſin of murther; <hi>deliver me from blood-guiltineſſe, thou God of my righteouſneſſe,</hi> verſe the ſixteenth. Nay, that which did principally affect him, was his unbeliefe, unthankfulneſſe, neglect, and contempt of the goodneſſe and mercy of God; and his making the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme. And therefore he ſaith, <hi>Against thee, thee only have I ſinned,</hi> verſe the ſixth. Though he had ſinned againſt
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:168516:108"/>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> againſt himſelfe, and againſt the Church: yet the moſt aggravating circumſtance was, that he had ſinned againſt God. This we may ſee in the parable of <hi>Nathan,</hi> who thereupon did argue with him, upon the conſiderations of mercies received: ſo then when the Pſalmiſt ſaith, I was borne in iniquity, he hath not reſpect only to the libidinous temper, but alſo to a ſinful temper, of a more general nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if</hi> David <hi>had meant this of himſelfe, and that in regard of original ſin, this had been ſo far from being a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential expreſſion, or a confeſſing of his ſinne, that it had been a plaine accuſation of God, and an excuſing of himſelfe. As if he had ſaid, O Lord, I confeſſe I have ſinned, in this horrible murther, and adultery; but thou O Lord knoweſt, how it comes to paſſe, even by that fatal puniſhment; which thou didſt, for the ſin of</hi> Adam, <hi>inflict on me and all mankind, above three thouſand years before I was borne. Thereby making me, to fall into ſo horrible corruption of nature, that unleſſe thou didſt unreſiſtibly force me from it, I cannot abſtaine from my ſin, being moſt naturally enclined to evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply</hi> To all which we rejoyne, though there was a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty laid upon <hi>David,</hi> as upon other men, to be borne in original ſinne, and this three thouſand years before he was borne; yet nevertheleſſe it will be no plea to excuſe his murther, and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery: For howſoever he was borne in ſinne, his murther, and adultery were his own voluntary acts. Ordinary experience ſhewetn (by the common aſſiſtance of God) that men have a power to avoid many outward evils, to which their natures are enclined. Further, for the inward luſt, though it was inflicted as a puniſhment upon him, as upon all mankind, this can be no charge upon God, ſeeing he hath provided a remedy, to help men out of their miſery. <hi>David</hi> had rather cauſe to accuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for fulfilling the luſts of his nature, and for the neglecting of that grace that was promiſed to him, and to other believers in the Jewiſh Church, to cleanſe out the ſin of the nature; <hi>I will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, that thou mighteſt love the Lord thy God,</hi> Deut. 30.6. So then, though <hi>David</hi> was born in original ſin, the fruits of that ſinne, were his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary acts, and the living in that ſinne alſo, was his own free
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:168516:108"/>choiſe. <hi>Bernard in his Homily</hi> 81. <hi>on the Canticles, hath an excellent paſſage to this purpoſe, Homo interveniente peccato, patitur quandam vincet ipſe, &amp;c. Man by the intervening of ſin, he himſelfe doth ſuffer a kinde of neceſſity from his will, not from nature, that ſo truely he may not be deprived of his inbred liberty: For that the ſoul cannot riſe of her ſelfe, the will is the cauſe, who languiſhing, and laying prostrate with the vitiated, and vicious love of a corrupted body, doth not withal admit the love of righteouſneſſe. It is ſo I know not by what wounderful meane, the will being made worſe, ſhe her ſelfe, doth make a neceſſity to her ſelfe; That the neceſſity while its voluntary, may not be able to excuſe the will: Neither the will while tis drawn, may have power to ſhake off the neceſſity: for truely after a ſort, this is a voluntary neceſſity.</hi> In theſe words of his, he doth elegantly ſet forth the truth of the thing, and therein he doth liken the ſoul to a man grovelling upon the earth, he cannot riſe becauſe he will not; He will not riſe becauſe his nature doth encline him to lye down under the power of his luſts. And this was <hi>Davids</hi> very caſe, he was born in iniquity, and he did freely and voluntarily bring forth the fruits, that were the very product, and reſult of a ſinful nature; he did too much neglect the grace by which he might be cured, and though his neceſſity was natural, reſpecting the inclinations that came from his birth, yet alſo it was a voluntary neceſſity; All natural men do account the liberty of luſts, to be the greateſt freedome, and therefore they be not captives ſo much againſt, as with their wills. The firſt ſtep therefore to ſalvation is, as to underſtand the guilt of ſinne, ſo alſo the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual captivity, and bondage of the ſoul, under the tyranny of a carnal mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly, He addeth, that</hi> David <hi>thought nothing of this, or any thing like it, we may understand by the preceding words, which are a preface to theſe in the objection, againſt thee only have I ſinned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> We willingly yield, that it was the purpoſe of <hi>David</hi> to cleare the juſtice of God, but here is no need to call his juſtice in queſtion, for though <hi>David</hi> was borne in ſin, the act of murther and adultery were the deeds of his own will, beſides, the luſt of his heart might have been cured by the grace of God.</p>

                     <hi>Seaventhly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if this had been natural and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, God, who knew perfectly well, would have expected nothing elſe of him.

                     <hi>Repl.</hi> The caſe is not all one. It is not in the nature of ſtones to ſpeak, but men may avoid many outward acts of ſinne, and the evil of their natural diſpoſition may be mortified by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of certain, that had eyes full of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, that <hi>cannot ceaſe from ſinne,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.14. Our Authour in his anſwer to the Biſhops letter doth expound, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>eyes full of the adultereſſe,</hi> therefore they cannot ceaſe from ſin. This ſheweth how hard it is to eſcape adultery, when men have received the beauty of the adultereſſe into their eye. Why then are Laws made againſt this ſinne? It is in their power out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to fly ſuch occaſions that lead thereto. The wiſe man ſaith, <hi>remove thy way farre from her, and come not neare the doore of her houſe.</hi> Is not this too preciſe and ſtrict a point? No, ſome mens natures, are like tinder to the fire; they muſt not onely fly ſinnes, but all occaſions that lead thereto. Now it is plain, that in theſe things, men have a power to forbear the evil; and therefore the wiſe man accordingly doth temper his exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And for the luſt of the heart, though a man cannot flee from it, yet God is able to give more grace, which he is alway ready to do to thoſe, who in the ſenſe of their own emptineſſe do flee to him for help. Where is the man that did ever truely deſire, and continue deſiring helps againſt his infirmities, that God did ever neglect? If this could be proved, then ſomething may be ſaid to the purpoſe. Now we go to the next Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:168516:110"/>ſpeech of men: cuſtome, and nature, are uſually oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, each to other. In ſome caſes a man may be ſaid to have a thing both by nature, and cuſtome, very rarely or never, we ſay that cuſtome is nature. Sometimes men ſpeak in a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſenſe, that cuſtome is as it were a ſecond nature; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſtands upon it, that it is moſt likely that the words of the Apoſtle, are meant onely of cuſtome, and acquired nature (for ſo he deſires to ſpeak) then by this rule we muſt ſay, that the beleeving Epheſians, before converſion, were by ill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome onely, the children of wrath. If this be ſo, why doth the <hi>Apoſtle ſay, you hath he quickned who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes:</hi> What need of the infuſion of a new life to bring them off off an ill cuſtome? In ſuch a caſe it were onely requiſite, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce nature to her original purity; and to amend that by good uſuages, which ill cuſtomes had marred. Beſides, ſeeing ſeveral Nations have their cuſtomes, was it a peculiar cuſtome to the Epheſians? Or was it common to all Nations to be the children of wrath? It was peculiar to the Epheſians, then they onely had need of the infuſion of a new life. If it was common to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: How did they all generally agree in ſuch a cuſtome? And what was the cauſe of the agreement?

If they may be ſaved without the infuſion of a new life, this will be againſt the ſcope of the Apoſtle, who tells us they were ſaved from wrath, by the inward quickning. But if he will ſay, that ſuch cannot be ſaved without the infuſion of a new life, then 'tis plain that by nature muſt be meant more than acquired na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Infants are born in a ſinful nature and do need the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Spirit. But he hath a paſſage out of <hi>Suidas, when the Apoſtle ſaith, you were by nature the children of wrath, he means not that which is the uſual ſignification of nature, for then it were not their fault but the fault of him that made them ſuch.</hi> To which we rejoyn, In men of ripe years, it is both their fault, that they do abide in the ſinne of the nature, and it is alſo the fault of <hi>Adam,</hi> that did vitiate and deprave the nature, at his fall. That men do fulfill the luſts of the fleſh and mind, is their own volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:168516:110"/>act. And though indeed and in truth, it is not their perſonal fault, that men are born in original ſinne, yet it is their fault that they fulfill the luſts of their nature; and continue in that ſtate, at leaſt that they do not uſe, and hearken to thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſory motions, and previous workings of the Spirit, which the Lord doth adminiſter to them, at ſome ſeaſons at leaſt; The end of all which is to bring them out of the evil of that ſtate.

                     <hi>By nature the Apostle</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>means not by birth, natural extraction, or any other original derivation from</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> By the ſame reaſon he might argue, that the Epheſians, when they were quickned, had not a new life by regeneration, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual extraction, out of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> which is immediatly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the other, as the counterpane or the other part of a deed. In ſeeking to deny the miſery by the firſt, he muſt take away the happineſſe, grace, and life that comes in by the ſecond man. But he gives his reaſon, <hi>The Epheſians were no more guilty than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one elſe, and no more before their converſion than after.</hi> We ſay the ſame in effect, and it is the force of our argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all need a new life, a new birth, a new extraction out of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as the Epheſians, therefore all are equally by nature the children of wrath, and do partake of the ſinne of the nature as well as they. But whereas he addes, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians were no more guilty of this ſinne before converſion than they were after, in this he is monſtrous abſurd: For after conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the guilt of that ſinne was done away, and the power of it was broken by the inward work of the Spirit; now he cannot ſay that this was done before their converſion. He further addeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By nature the children of wrath, muſt be expounded, as much as</hi>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:168516:111"/>ſervice to them, that by nature were no gods, that is, which really are none.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> We may underſtand the meaning of the Apoſtle, in this Scripture, by comparing it with others, <hi>God that made the world and all that is therein, dwelleth not in Temples made with hands,</hi> Acts 17.24. <hi>The inviſible things of him are clearly ſeen from the creation of the world, even his eternal power and Godhead,</hi> Rom 1.20. So in the preſent caſe, when the Galatians did ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to thoſe that by nature were not gods, his meaning is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but this, they did ſervice to them that had not the eſſence, and the being of the Godhead. As in a little caſe, the nature of Birds, Beaſts, and Fiſhes, is taken for the eſſence, and the being it ſelf. As in the expreſſion of Saint <hi>James, every kinde of Birds, that is,</hi> every nature of Birds, Beaſts, and Fiſhes <hi>is tamed, and hath been tamed</hi> by mankind, or according to the original <hi>by the nature of man.</hi> So in the preſent caſe, when the Apoſtle ſaith that the Epheſians were by nature the children of wrath, he doth not ſay onely that they were really, and truly, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath. For ſo they might be by ill-cuſtome, when their nature was good, as the water is really and truely hot, though it be not naturally hot: But his meaning is this, that their very eſſence, and being was ſinful, and that their corruption was in the very nature it ſelf, as they did derive out of <hi>Adam</hi> a common root. The ſcope of the text, doth plainly ſhew that this is the meaning: the ſinfulneſſe of nature, immediately oppoſed to that life, ſpiritualneſſe, and new nature they had from the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. And whereas he ſaith, as theſe Epheſians were before their converſion, ſo were the Iſraclites in the dayes of their rebellion, a wicked ſtubborne people, inſomuch that they are by the Prophet called children of tranſgreſſion, a ſeed of falſhood.</hi> All this doth confirme the truth of our interpretation he calleth them a ſeed of evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, meaning that they were not onely ſinners by cuſtome, and evil enſample, but by propagation of the kind. Let him grant this in the caſe of the Epheſians, and the queſtion is at an end.</p>
                  <p>This is all that he hath in his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num Neceſſarium.</hi> Now let us conſider what further he ſaith, to this Scripture, in his anſwer to the Biſhops letter,</p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:168516:111"/>
                  <p> Here he tells us, <hi>that theſe words do not at all relate to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of original, but to the ſtate of Heathens ſinnes, habitual Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and impurities;</hi> in which the <hi>world was dead, before the great Reformation by Chriſt</hi> page 74.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> By this account when the Epheſians had a new life infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, this was onely to cure them of their heatheniſh Idolatries, and ſuperſtitions: In which ſenſe the Jewes (free from ſuch I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries) needed no new life at all Beſides, how is it poſſible that the words are to be underſtood, onely of heatheniſh Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and impurities, when the Apoſtle himſelf expreſſely ſaith, <hi>among whom we all had our converſation.</hi> Did he live in heatheniſh I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries before his converſion, or was he an Idolater before his calling? But ſeeing our Authour tells us, how <hi>the Biſhop did admoniſh him to remember how often the Apoſtle calleth concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, ſinne;</hi> we will urge the text a little more cloſely, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is the value of his anſwers. To ground the buſineſſe, we argue thus. If the Epheſians were accounted the children of wrath, becauſe they had their converſation in the luſts of the fleſh; by this reaſon then, the fleſh muſt needs be evil, becauſe it was evil, to converſe in thoſe luſts. Further, to come to the point, If the luſts of the fleſh be evil, it muſt be true in a ſenſe, that the fleſh it ſelf muſt be more evil, becauſe it is the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from which the luſts do ſtreame. When he hath ſaid all that he can, when he hath accuſed the Epheſians of an evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, of evil cuſtomes, of evil acts, of evil deſires, he muſt come to an evil nature, that lies at the bottome, and that which is worſt of all, he will find it to be the very root, and cauſe of the the miſchief. The Apoſtle doth very elegantly call all luſts, the works and effects of the fleſh, becauſe they are the effects, that the fleſh doth produce, in oppoſition to the effects and fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. This ground being laid, let us come to his exceptions as they follow in their order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I know Saint Paul reckons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence to be one of the works of the fleſh, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſuch as excludes from heaven,</hi> Col. 3.5. <hi>[Evil concupiſcence] concupiſcence with ſomething ſuperadded, but certainly, that is nothing that is natural: for God made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:168516:112"/>that is evil; and whatſoever is natural and neceſſary cannot be mortified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> That which is natural and neceſſary by creation, we confeſſe cannot, nor ought not to be mortified. Of this kind is the luſt after meat, drink, ſleep, &amp;c. but that which is natural, and neceſſary by corruption, ought chiefly to be mortified; nay, it is the prime work of Chriſtianity, to put off the <hi>Adam</hi>-like, and by degrees to put on the Chriſt-like diſpoſition, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. He proceedeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I come</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to conſider that by concupiſcence either muſt be meant the first inclinations to their object, or the proper acts of Election, which are the ſecond acts of concupiſcence. If the firſt inclinations be meant, then certainly that cannot be a ſinne, which is natural, and neceſſary?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> We do willingly admit ſuch a diſtinction, concupiſcence is ſometime taken for the habit, or the root it ſelf, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for thoſe ſecond acts that do flow from the root. Now in ſuch a caſe it is to me a great wonder that any ſhould own the ſecond acts of concupiſcence to be ſinne, and yet own no ſinfulneſſe in the concupiſcence, that is more radical and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental. Acts do flow from the nature, and therefore where acts be bad, the nature cannot be good. It is our Saviours own argument, <hi>Men do not gather grapes of thornes, nor figs of thistles.</hi> And whereas he ſtands upon this ſubtilty, <hi>that the firſt inclinations are unavoidable, therefore they are not ſinful.</hi> If he means that they are abſolutely unavoidable, this we deny. For that which is unavoidable by nature, may be avoided by grace. The guilt of concupiſcence may be taken away that it be not imputed, the power of it may be broken by the Spirit, and the remainders of it may be clean extinguiſhed in the life of glory. Now he proceedeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To deſire that to which all men tend naturally is no more a ſin, than to deſire to be happy is a ſin. Deſire is no more a ſin, than joy or ſorrow is.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> If he ſpeak of the natural tendency of deſire, as it is by creation; We willingly ſubſcribe, and ſo it is no ſinne to deſire to eat, drink, or to long after an happy eſtate. But if he ſpeak
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:168516:112"/>of natural deſires, as they are now ſince the fall; The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the fleſh do wholly rend to evil. <hi>The fleſh luſteth</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Then there can be no reaſon told, why it is more a ſin to will evil than to understand it: and how doth that which is moral, differ from that which is natural? For the underſtanding is firſt, and primely moved by his object.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> The Scripture doth teſtifie of the blindneſſe of the minde, and the perverſity of the judgement, as well as of the pravity of the will. Not to go far for an inſtance, the words of the text are plaine. The <hi>Epheſians</hi> are ſaid to be the children of wrath, under this title, and formality, becauſe they did ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the <hi>luſts of their minde;</hi> or according to the original, <hi>the wills of their cogitations,</hi> and their reaſonings. They are tearmed the wills of the cogitation, becauſe the choiſe of the will, and the diſorder of that choiſe, doth ariſe commonly from the blindneſſe of judgement. As for his queſtion, <hi>how doth that which is natural, differ from that which is moral:</hi> We need not trouble our ſelves in the buſineſſe. For the blindneſſe of the judgement, and the perverſity of the will, are natural and moral both. They are natural, ſo far forth as they come by propagation from the firſt root: they are moral, in reſpect of the anomy, and irregularity, as being contrary to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, holy, and pure law of God. He goeth on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I cannot but wonder ſaith he, why men are pleaſed where-ever they finde the word concupiſcence in the new Teſtament, preſently to dreame of original ſinne, and make that to be the ſumme total of it: whereas concupiſcence, if it were the product of</hi> Adams <hi>fall, is but one ſmall part of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> There is a double reaſon may be given (as I conceive) where men finde mention made of concupiſcence, they do thereby underſtand original ſinne; Firſt, becauſe that ſinne is commonly called by the title of concupiſcence. Secondly, Thoſe derivative concupiſcences (as I may ſo ſay) which are by choice and election, do all flow from the mother concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, and do exceedingly ſymbolize with her. As in that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:168516:113"/>famous paſſage of the Apoſtle. <hi>Every man is drawn away with his own luſt, and enticed, and luſt, when it hath conceived, it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth ſinne, and ſinne when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death,</hi> Jam. 1.14, 15. By ſinne he muſt needs meane, the open act of ſinne, as it is in the publick view of man. After this he ſpeaks of finiſhing of ſinne, when men have filled the meaſure of their iniquity, then death comes at laſt, as the wages of ſin. Though this be ſo in the end, yet at the firſt, all ſin is brooded in the luſt of the heart. All ſecondary acts of concupiſcence do ſpring from the original concupiſcence, which is the cauſe of all. Upon theſe grounds. The ſinful diſpoſition of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may well paſſe under the name, and notion of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence; becauſe the operations within, do chiefly conſiſt in luſting, and all the acts of ſinne do flow from the luſt of the heart within.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concupiſcence</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is but one of the paſſions, and in the utmoſt extenſion of the word, it can be taken but for one halfe of the paſſions, for not only all the paſſions of the concupiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faculty can be a principle of ſinne, but the iraſcible doth more hurt in the world: that is more ſenſual, this more deviliſh,</hi> pag. 94.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> It is true in moral Philoſophy, the uſual diſtinction is into <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> the iraſcible and concupiſcible faculty, but what need is there of ſuch a difference in the caſe that we now ſpeak? for the Apoſtle reckons up the luſts of the fleſh, adultery, fornication, uncleanneſſe, hatred, variance, emulation, &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. There is no man will doubt, but in this liſt or catalogue, he hath reſpect as well to things that belong to the iraſcible, as to the concupiſcible faculty; yet all is contained under the notion, and name of concupiſcence. For in the verſes immediately going before, he exhorteth, <hi>walk in the Spirit, and ye ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh.</hi> According to the original, it is, ye ſhall not accompliſh <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>the concupiſcence of the fleſh.</hi> In the preſent caſe then when the <hi>Galathians</hi> did live in malice, envy, hateful, and hating one another, they did fulfill the concupiſcence of the fleſh. And ſo by this account the luſts, both of the concupiſcible, and the iraſcible faculty are comprehended (more generally)
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:168516:113"/>under one name and title of concupiſcence. And all his contrary reaſoning is juſt nothing at all. Now let us come to his laſt Scripture.</p>

                     <hi>An animal man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that is a Philoſopher, or a rational man, ſuch as were the Greeke and Roman Philoſophers, upon the ſtock and account of the learning of all the Schooles, could not diſcern the excellency of the Goſpel-myſteries as of God, incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, Christ dying, the reſurrection of the body, and the like.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Its true, that the Philoſophers aforementioned, were ſuch natural, or animal men, but it is not the whole truth; For they that come to Church, and publickly profeſſe, may be animal men alſo, and in their animality may be far from receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things of the Spirit. A ſchoole-boy, that is able ſome way to make a Gramatical conſtruction of the Greek of <hi>Euclide,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> is not preſently capable, of the myſteries of Geometry, and Aſtronomy. That requireth the skill of an Artiſt, as well as of a Gramarian. And, if the laws of the land were tranſlated into Engliſh. I think we ſhould not be all Lawyers out of hand. So in the preſent caſe, though all may outwardly own, and ſome may preach the Doctrine, and myſteries of ſalvation, this doth not preſently entitle them, to that kinde of learning that comes only by the teaching of the Spirit. Many may ſpeak much of the love of Chriſt, that never had the feeling of it in their hearts. <hi>Moſes</hi> tells the people in his time, <hi>ye have ſeen all that the Lord did before your eyes, yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to ſee, and eares to heare unto this day,</hi> Deut. 29.24. They did ſee, and they did not ſee, they did outwardly ſee the works, but they did not inwardly believe the truth, wiſedome, goodneſſe, and power of God. For had they ſeen theſe things, as they ought, they could not but have loved the Lord their God, and have lived
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:168516:114"/>in obedience to his laws. So then, not only the Greek Philoſophers; but many Chriſtians alſo, may be called natural, or animal men. He further ſheweth what anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Animality, which is a reliance upon natural principles, without revelation is a ſtate privatively oppoſed to the Spirit, and a man in that ſtate cannot be ſaved, becauſe he wants a vital part, he wants the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> What he ſaith here, and in the words immediately following is the ſame in ſubſtance, that we ſpeak, and is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the deſigne that he derives at. For if in the ſtate of animality, a man cannot be ſaved, becauſe he wants the Spirit, the chief vital of ſalvation; Why doth he (to make religion intelligible) deny original ſin, plead for the freedome of the will, and eſtabliſh the purity of the natural birth. We ſay, becauſe a man is borne in original ſin, and dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, therefore he cannot be ſaved, without the infuſion of a new life. He ſaith that a man in his animality cannot go to heaven, without the Spirit, the chiefe vital of ſalvation. Let a wiſe man now, judge where we and he do differ. But to blind the buſineſſe, he hath a ſubtle diſtinction between carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and animality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Carnality,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>or the ſtate of being in the fleſh, is not only privatively oppoſed, but contrarily alſo to the ſpiritual ſtaee of grace.</hi>

                     <hi>Rep.</hi> This expreſſion of his, might paſſe well enough, were it not for that which followeth. Firſt, ſpeaking of the ſtate of animality, and then of carnality afterwards, he hath theſe words. <hi>The firſt is only an imperfection, and a want of ſupernatural aides, the other is indeed, a direct ſtate of ſin, and hated by God, but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduced by choice, and not diſcending naturally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> In this expreſſion of his there are two things, that need a better enquiry. Firſt, how doth he prove that the ſtate of animality is only a ſtate of meer imperfection, and no more? St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>the wiſdome from beneath, is earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh;</hi> or according to the original, earthly, <hi>animal</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> deviliſh. I think none will ſay, that the animality of this wiſdome, is a bare imperfection, and no more. Its poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed to the wiſdome that is above, and can there be a
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:168516:114"/>greater enemy, to the wiſedome above, then that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath? The Apoſtle St. <hi>Jude</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>that Mockers ſhould come walking after their ungodly luſts. Theſe are they that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves, ſenſual, not having the Spirit.</hi> ver. 18, 19. the word is, they are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>animal,</hi> not having the Spirit. Now in this caſe will any man be ſo void of underſtanding, to affirme that theſe in their animality, were meerly defective, and that they were not in a direct ſtate of enmity againſt God? I think none will eaſily aſſert it. Sure I am many enſamples may be brought, to prove the diſtinction between animality and carnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be a meer <hi>non-ens,</hi> or nullity. Secondly, we agree that the ſtate of carnality, is a ſtate of ſin, and hated of God; but whereas he ſaith that <hi>it is only ſuperinduced by choice, as alſo that it doth not naturally deſcend.</hi> Herein we crave liberty to depart from him. The Scriptures all along (ſpecially the writings of St. <hi>Paul</hi>) ſpeak of the fleſh, in oppoſition to the Spirit. Now will he, or any man elſe, aſſert that this is a ſtate meerly ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced, and that men come to be fleſh, purely by the choice of their own will? If this be ſo, how do all come to agree in one and the ſame choice? All do not agree to be Souldiers, to be Scholars, to be Merchants, to be Mariners, yet all are fleſh, before they come to be ſanctified by the Spirit. Seeing he will not have this ſtate naturally to deſcend, let him aſſigne ſome general cauſe, how all do agree to be carnal. Neceſſarily ſome general cauſe muſt lye at the bottome; but he further ſaith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam did leave us all in an animal state, but this is not a ſtate of anmity, of direct oppoſition to God, but a ſtate inſufficient, and imperfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> This ſtate of meer imperfection, which he ſpeaks ſo much of, both here and elſe-where, is only a notion of his own commenting. For when God made man in the beginning, he made him in a ſtate very good, but when he fell, he left all his poſterity, not only in an imperfect, but in a ſinful condition. As for that middle ſtate of deficiency, which he imagins, I know not where it is to be found, unleſſe it be in the Atlantis of <hi>Plate.</hi> Beſides, if animality be only a ſtate of deficiency, why doth the Apoſtle ſo plainly tell us, that the animal man receives
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:168516:115"/>not the things of the Spirit, they are fooliſhneſſe unto him. This cannot be a ſtate of meer imperfection, but a ſtate of direct oppoſition, the principles of animality diametrally oppoſite to the things of the Spirit, <hi>Michal</hi> ſcoft at <hi>Davids</hi> dancing before the Ark. <hi>Lot</hi> ſeemed to his ſons-in-law to be as one that mockt, when he told them of the deſtruction of the City; the preaching of the croſſe ſeemed to be very meane matter to the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and learned Grecians. Now ſhall we ſay that all theſe were only in a ſtate of animality or imperfection, and no more? I think none will eaſily believe it. But in the cloſe of all he hath theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the ſtate of animality</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a man cannot go to heaven, but neither will that alone carry them to hell, and therefore God doth not let a man alone in that ſtate, for either God ſuggests to him that which is ſpiritual, or if he doth not, it is becauſe himſelfe hath ſuperinduced ſomething that is carnal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> We are told here of a ſtate, that carries neither to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven nor to hell: and I beleeve if we go to men of ripe years, there is no man lives in this eſtate in all <hi>Aſia, Africa, Europe,</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> Why then doth he trouble us with that which is not? Further, we do agree, that the Lord doth (at ſeaſons) ſuggeſt ſomething that is ſpiritual to animal men; by this they are enabled to ſee their own miſery, and to judge themſelves. Now this doth rather ſtrengthen the force of the argument, for if an animal man could purely of himſelfe, perceive the things of the Spirit, what need had he of the ſuggeſtion of the Spirit? But for that which he addeth, <hi>that the animal man doth ſuperinduce ſomething that is carnal,</hi> I think this cannot reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be denyed, and therefore I do not ſee, but the ſtate of animality and carnality both are equal eſtates of enmity againſt God. Thus have I been more large in clearing thoſe Scriptures which concerne the maine of the queſtion: in others of leſſe moment I will be more briefe.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this account alone</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it must be impoſſible to be conſented unto, that God ſhould ſtill under the Goſpel, after ſo many generations of vengance, and taking puniſhment for the ſinne, after the publication of ſo many mercies and ſo infinite a graciouſneſſe, that is revealed to mankind in Jeſus Chriſt, after ſo great proviſions againſt ſin, even the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible threatnings of damnation ſtill to perſevere to puniſh</hi> Adam, <hi>in his poſterity and the poſterity for that he never did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> In this paſſage of his, he doth ſhew how much he doth miſtake the ſcope of Scripture, for it is the chiefe deſigne of the holy Ghoſt, to amplifie the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and all the evil that comes thereby, to the end that all might be humbled, and that they might come to Chriſt as to a Sovereigne remedy to help them in their miſery. And in very deed, whatſoever he thinks to the contrary, the Doctrine of the Goſpel cannot be ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached, without the knowledge of that miſery that came by the fall. The knowledge of the one, doth as it were open a doore to the knowledge of the other.</p>
               <p>Againe, in the whole proceſſe of the diſcourſe he is very faliacious. Suppoſe ordinarily God doth not now puniſh the fathers ſin upon the children, is this a good argument to prove that the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> is not rightly imputed to poſterity? Other Parents (comparatively) are but private perſons, and their ſins are but the ſins of private men, but <hi>Adam</hi> was the root of the nature, and his ſin was the ſin of the whole kind. As on the other ſide, the ſuffering of Chriſt upon the croſſe, was not the ſuffering of a private perſon, but the ſuffering of the whole humane nature. By this the loſt ſons of men have a doore of grace opened, the tender of grace is made to all, and the great condemnation is for unbelief. Now we will conſider what the rules are which he doth lay down.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Firſt, (ſaith he) God may and doth very often bleſſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:168516:116"/>to reward the Fathers piety, as it is notorious in the famous deſcent of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family. But the ſame is not the reaſon of favours and puniſhments.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 
                  <q>Here we would entreat him to obſerve that it is true, that for a long deſcent, God did ſhew kindneſſe to the family of <hi>Abraham:</hi>
                  </q> but if he well obſerve the matter, this kindneſſe was extended, not ſo much for <hi>Abrahams</hi> piety, as for the Lords own promiſe, and for his truth in keeping the promiſe. Againe, whereas he ſaith, <hi>There is not the ſame reaſon of favours, and puniſhments:</hi> let him ſhew why the Jewes are caſt away, why they have been little better than out-caſts of the Covenant, now above one thouſand five hundred years? Queſtionleſſe, as God will magnifie his mercy in their call: ſo for many ages together, they have ſtood and do yet ſtand under the burthen of that heavy curſe, which they did wiſh upon themſelves, <hi>his blood be upon us and our children,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God never imputes the ſin to the ſon, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative formally making him guilty, or being angry with the innocent eternally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though we ſhould ſay, the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> is imputed to all his relatives, and that alſo to their eternal damnation; this in the whole were no hard aſſertion: as long as we teach, that a ſecond man is provided for eternal ſalvation. We wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly yeild, as the caſe now ſtandeth, the great condemnation is for the neglect, and the contempt of that ſalvation, mercy, and grace that is to be had by Chriſt. If men run out the years of the patience, and long-ſuffering of God; if they continue in unbelife, and hardneſſe of heart; if they reſiſt the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and operations of the Spirit, as they are adminiſtred in their reſpective ſeaſons. I think it is but juſt, that they ſhould fall, not only under the guilt of their own actual ſins: but under the eternal damnation alſo, that was brought upon them by the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> the root of the nature. All the hurt of ſuch a poſition (if it be a hurt) is more vigorouſly to drive men to Chriſt. As for infants, though they are fallen into all kinds of miſerie, temporal, and eternal by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin: what harme, as long as ſo faire a probability may be extended to them in Chriſt: God is a gracious God, and he is able to ſhew mercy where
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:168516:116"/>the ſin was the act, and deed of another. Of believers infants, we have a more ſpecial ground of hope. So then the matter will come to this iſſue; Though infants may be miſerable by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> nay may be made eternally miſerable through him: yet here is the comfort, that mercy may be extended to them in Chriſt. He further addeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, when God inflicts a temporal evil upon the ſon for the fathers ſin, he doth it as a Judge to the father, but as a Lord only to the ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Suppoſe this were granted, it makes nothing to the purpoſe; all other Parents in compariſon, are but private men: but <hi>Adam</hi> as a publick perſon, did repreſent the whole nature. That may be aſſerted of him, which cannot be of any other: The Apoſtle expreſſely ſaith, by the diſobedience of one, many were made ſinners. If they were made ſinners only by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, this is enough to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and other progenitours. Againe, in the fame place it is expreſſely ſaid, <hi>by one mans offence, judgement came upon all men to condemnation.</hi> If it came upon all men to condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all are under the ſentence of the Judge, for the ſin of one man. And whereas he ſaith. <hi>If God inflicts a temporal evil upon the ſon for the fathers ſin, he doth it not as a Judge, but as a Lord only to the ſon.</hi> Upon this account I demand, the Lord inflicting evil upon the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> for his ſin, doth he only inflict it in a prerogative way to the ſon? then it will follow, that Chriſt muſt dye, and by ſhedding of his blood, he muſt take away ſuch evils (from infants at leaſt) that are brought upon them in the way of prerogative. This would be a ſtrange ſound, to ſuch eares that have alway heard, and believed that we come to be ſinners in <hi>Adam,</hi> and Chriſt came to take away the guilt of that ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, God uſing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the power, and dominion of a Lord, and the ſeverity of a Judge, did puniſh poſterity, it was but ſo long as the Parents might live, and ſee it, as</hi> Chryſoſtome <hi>ſaith, to the third and fourth generation, and no longer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this be ſo, why do the Jewes at this day beare the burthen of that ſin, committed many hundred years ago? why
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:168516:117"/>did God inflict judgements upon the houſe of <hi>Ely,</hi> of <hi>Saul,</hi> of <hi>Ahab,</hi> of <hi>Jehu,</hi> and of others, when the Parents were dead? Beſides, if God ſhould have ſuch a purpoſe to puniſh the Parents in the children, that thereby the Parents themſelves might be brought to repentance; this is not a parallel caſe, to that which we are upon. God ſuffered <hi>Adam</hi> to fall, and in falling, to involve himſelfe, and his poſterity under all miſeries, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and eternal; that ſo a doore might be opened, for the grace that comes by Chriſt. In this regard the Apoſtle expreſſely tells us, that the <hi>first man is the figure of him that is to come.</hi> This muſt not, nor cannot be ſaid of our immediate Parents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> he addeth, <hi>this power and dominion, which God uſeth, was not in ordinary caſes, but in the biggest crimes only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let this be admitted, it doth abundantly confirme the truth of our aſſertion. For the caſe of <hi>Adam</hi> was more than ordinary, there is no ſuch enſample like his, from the beginning of the world. He ſtood as a publick man, as a root of the nature, the whole ſtock was put into his hand, he had but one only way by which he might fall; and therefore he falling, it is no ſuch irrational thing to conceive, that all his poſterity ſhould fall with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Although God threatned this, and hath a right and a power to do this; yet he doth not often uſe this right, but only in ſuch notable enſamples, as were ſufficient to all ages, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and teſtifie his great indignation againſt thoſe things, for the puniſhment of which he was pleaſed to uſe his right or rights of dominion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, there are ſome ſpecial enſamples of the Lords judgement upon whole families, for their fathers ſin; this may be ſeen in the caſes of <hi>Corah, Achan, Saul, Jeroboam, Ahab,</hi> and others. Neither do we doubt, but the Lords end was to teſtifie to all ages, his indignation againſt ſin, by ſuch like inſtances of his ſeverity. But what is this to the purpoſe in hand? the end wherefore the Lord did lay ſuch an heavy burthen upon the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> was not ſo much that the children ſhould take heed, by the enſample of their father, for there were ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:168516:117"/>that the children could not poſſibly imitate the father; but a prime end of the miſery of the ſons of men, by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> is to open a door, for the grace that comes by Chriſt. The knowledge of the one contrary doth exceedingly conduce to the knowledge of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seaventhly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>his goodneſſe, and graciouſneſſe grew quickly weary of this way of proceeding. They were the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Law, and God did not delight in them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the time of Ezekiel the Prophet, he declared againſt them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This paſſage of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the Prophet, doth of all others ſingularly make for our purpoſe. For though <hi>Adam</hi> did eate of the forbidden fruit, and all his poſterity did, and do bear the burthen of his ſinne: yet they are not left, in that ſtate irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, without all kinde of help. A doore of grace is opened for the loſt ſonnes of men, by the coming of Chriſt; upon this ground, the truth of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> ſpeech is founded, <hi>the ſoule that ſinneth, that ſoul ſhall die.</hi> His meaning is, the ſoul that ſinneth and continueth in his ſin, through impenitency and unbelief, that ſoul ſhall dye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſomething extraordinary, was then need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be done, to ſo vile a people, to reſtrain their ſinfulneſſe; but when the Goſpel was publiſhed, and hell-fire threatned to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſovering, and greater ſinners, the former way of puniſhment was quite left off. And in all the Goſpel, there is not one word of threatning paſſing beyond the perſon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I marvell how it cometh to paſſe then, that the Jewes do beare the burthen of their Anceſtors ſinne, as we have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſaid. Beſides, if we diligently look to the ſcope of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, we ſhall finde that the Lord doth puniſh the poſterity for the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> that ſo thereby a way may be prepared for the grace that comes by Chriſt Theſe things are not oppoſite, or contrary, but ſubordinate and ſubalternate, the miſeries by the fall do prepare the way for the grace that comes by Chriſt. But he further addeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Either this evil</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that falls upon us for</hi> Adams <hi>ſin, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon us by way of proper puniſhment, or by right of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:168516:118"/>dominion, if by proper puniſhment to us, then we underſtand not the juſtice of it, becauſe we were not perſonally guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If we cannot underſtand the juſtice of it, becauſe we were not perſonally guilty, why by the ſame reaſon doth he not wholly exclude us from having any part of ſhare in the benefit of the death of Chriſt. For what perſonal act or concurrence have we to the ſuffering of that death. And whereas he alledgeth the enſamples of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> the Grecian General, <hi>Avidius Caſſius,</hi> and others, that would not puniſh the children for the fathers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: We acknowledge the rationality and the equity of ſuch proceedings, but what is this to the caſe in hand? The Law was ſo given to <hi>Adam,</hi> that was never given to any elſe but to Chriſt alone. It was given to him as the Headman, and the root of the nature. If he fell, all muſt fall with him Neither is there any hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or harſhneſſe in this doctrine as long as the miſery by one doth open a door for the grace by the other. He goes on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>inflicts this evil upon Adams poſterity by uſing his own right of power, and dominion, which he hath over his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; then it is a strange anger which God had againſt</hi> Adam <hi>that he ſtill retaines ſo fierce an indignation as not to take off his hand from ſtriking after five thouſand ſix hundred years; and ſtriking him for that of which he repented him, and which in all reaſon we beleeve he then pardoned or reſolved to pardon when he promiſed the Meſſiah to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If he would but remember himſelf what he ſpeaks elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, he ſhall finde that he ſaith the ſame in effect as we do. For though in his further explication, <hi>page</hi> 453. He affirmeth that <hi>Adam</hi> was made mortal, and proves it by his eating, and drinking, his ſleep, and recreation, by ingeſtion, and egeſtion by breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, generating, and the like, which immortal ſubſtances never do. Though by theſe and ſuch like <hi>mediums,</hi> he endeavours to prove the mortality of the ſtate in which he was made, yet in the ſame and other places he doth acknowledge that the untimelineſſe and infelicity of death, came in by the fall. <hi>By the fall he tells us that</hi> Adam <hi>was caſt into a place of labour and uneaſineſſe of bryars and thornes, ill aire, and violent chances. The woman was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:168516:118"/>to hard labour and travell, and that which troubled her moſt, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to her husband, &amp;c.</hi> Now let us take the miſery brought in by the fall in ſuch a low and diminutive ſenſe that he would take it. It is now above five thouſand ſix hundred yeares that mankind hath been under the miſeries and infelicities of death, all this while they have continued in a place of labour and unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of ill aire, and hard chances, the woman alſo beſides the paines and peril of child-birth hath been ſubject to her husband for five thouſand ſix hundred years, and yet ſhe knows no end of her apprentiſhip. As ſtrange as the anger is againſt <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity, he muſt needs ſay the ſame in effect as we do. But to give a poſitive anſwer. Theſe miſeries brought in by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> have continued, and muſt continue to the end of the world. Neither is it a ſtrange thing that the Lord ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his anger, ſeeing by the continuation thereof he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to drive men to Chriſt. If he pleaſed he could immediately take away all theſe miſeries brought in by the fall. But for moſt excellent ends to humble men to pluck down their pride, to beat them out of their carnal ſecurity, he doth rather ſuffer them to abide. And for the caſe of the woman. The Apoſtle doth not deny her pains and perill of child-birth to come in by the fall, but then he addeth, <hi>they ſhall be ſaved in child-bearing if they continue in the faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. laſt. Notable to this purpoſe is that ſpeech of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to <hi>Julian</hi> the Pelagian, <hi>eſt enim aliquid in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>b<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dito &amp; alto ejus conſilio, &amp;c. There is therefore a reaſon in his hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and deep counſel, why ſo long as we live in this mortal fleſh, there is ſomething in us againſt which our mind may conflict, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we may ſay forgive us our treſpaſſes. And a little after therefore it is done in the place of our infirmity, that we ſhould not live proudly, but ſhould live under a daily need of remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> Much more to the ſame purpoſe. What he addes is monſtrous falſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not eaſily</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to be imagined, how Chriſt reconciled the world unto his Father, if after the death of Chriſt, God is ſo angry with mankind, ſo unappeaſed, that the moſt innocent part of mankind may periſh for</hi> Adams <hi>ſinne; and the other are perpetually puniſhed with a corrupted nature, a proneneſſe to ſinne, a ſervile will, a filthy concupiſcence, and an impoſſibility of being innocent; that no faith,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:168516:119"/>no Sacrament, no prayers, no induſtry, can obtain pardon from this puniſhment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It were a very happy thing, if this learned man would once think that there were a ninth commandment, and that he would make conſcience of bearing falſe-witneſſe againſt his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. We ſay, as the caſe now ſtandeth, men are peſtred with a corrupted nature, with a proneneſſe to ſinne, with a ſervile will, but that there is no remedy to bring us out of this evil, this was never affirmed by us. There is in the blood of Chriſt that which will take away the guilt of ſinne, in the Spirit of Chriſt to free us from the bondage of corruption, and alſo in his power to raiſe our bodies at the laſt. Onely it is the good will and pleaſure of God in the whole Oeconomy of the ſalvation of man, that we ſhould wait till all theſe things be fulfilled. That is a moſt ſweet paſſage of <hi>Bede</hi> taken from ſome ancienter Authour. <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>taketh away ſinne, which the Law, although holy, and juſt, and good, could not take away; but he in whom there was no ſin.

                  <hi>SECT. 4.</hi> Of the cauſes of the univerſal wickedneſſe of mankind.</head>
               <p>In the beginning he doth take upon him to propound an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. <hi>If there were not ſome common principle of evil introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the ſinne of our parents upon all his poſterity, how ſhould all men be ſo naturally inclined to be vicious.</hi> To this he endeavours to frame many anſwers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if we will ſuppoſe that there muſt be a cauſe in our nature determining us to ſinne, by an unreſiſtible neceſſity, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know why ſuch a principle ſhould be more neceſſary to us, than it was to</hi> Adam?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> As I have ſaid before, <hi>Adam</hi> had onely a poſſibility to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:168516:119"/>ſinne, he did ſinne ſo, that he had liberty, and freedome not to ſin; But as the caſe now ſtandeth, we can do nothing elſe but ſin. It is true in the particular, every man is free in the committing of this, or that particular ſin, though it be true in the General, an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit. It is poſſible that an healthy man, by diſorder, may fall into great ſickneſſes, but a man of frail, and infirme conſtitution, is wholly enclined to ſick<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſes and diſeaſes. As great, nay, a farre greater difference, was between that liberty that <hi>Adam</hi> had before his fall, and what we now have. He had a freedome to chooſe the good, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the evil; ſo have not we now. But to take away the force of this anſwer, he further argueth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That we can chooſe the good, and as naturally love good as evil, and in ſome instances more. A man cannot natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hate God, if he knowes any thing of him; a man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally loves his parents, he naturally hateth ſome ſorts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> We do not deny, but (by the general concurrence and aſſiſtance of God) man ſince the fall, hath ſome ability to chooſe, and love the good: But what kind of good? that which is ethical and moral, but not that which is ſpiritual. In the very beſt actions that a natural man doth, when he gives alms, when he obſerves promiſes, when he doth performe any good, he ſins in the manner; becauſe his actions do not proceed from ſincere love, neither are they directed to a right end. <hi>The end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart, a good conſcience, and faith unfaigned,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.5.</p>
               <p>Becauſe a natural man wants theſe principles, his beſt actions are ſtained with ſinne. As ſtrange as this doctrine ſeemes to be, there is none of us all, but may finde a truth of it in our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. For let us heare, reade, pray, meditate, give alms, diſpute for the truth, reforme errours and abuſes, and do much good for the Church; yet we can have no comfort if our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience once tell us, that we do not theſe things for God, but for our ſelves. This is the very caſe of every natural man beſides the ſiniſterity of ends, his actions do not proceed from right principles. And whereas he argueth, <hi>that a man cannot naturally hate God if he knowes any thing of him.</hi> If he ſpeak of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:168516:120"/>of God, and his holineſſe? In ſuch a ſenſe if men did know him they could not hate him. For that they love him, fear him, obey him, truſt in him, do all for him, leave all for his ſake, this is grounded upon the right knowledge of that excellency, and goodneſſe that is in himſelf. And therefore ſince the fall, the blindneſſe of minde is the cauſe of a great part of the miſchief. The will is perverſe in her choice; the affections are out of order, becauſe the judgment is not rightly informed. In a lower ſenſe we do acknowledge, that men may know ſome things of God, and their knowledge may be the ground of their hatred of God. It may be with ſome wicked men, as with the Devils, <hi>they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve there is one God, and tremble.</hi> But as to the choice of ſpiritual good, he further ſaith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither was</hi> Adams <hi>caſe better than ours in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. For that his nature could not carry him to heaven, or indeed to pleaſe God in order to it ſeems to be confeſſed by them who have therefore affirmed him to have a ſupernatural righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> If the collation be between ſtate and ſtate <hi>Adam</hi> had a power to underſtand that good which is ſpiritual, tolove &amp; chooſe it more than we now have ſince the fall. The wiſe man ſaith, <hi>God made man upright, but they have ſought out many inventions, Eccleſ.</hi> 7. <hi>ult.</hi> He muſt needs ſpeak of a ſpiritual uprightneſſe contrary to the deceits that are to be found amongſt thouſands of men and women. And whereas he ſaith that <hi>Adams</hi> nature could not carry him to heaven. If this be ſo, God provided worſe for him than for the reſt of the creatures. The reſt of the creatures were made with ſuch natures ſutable to their ends. If therefore God did not make <hi>Adam</hi> in a ſtate ſomeway fit for heaven, why did he create him with an immortal ſoule? This ſtate plainly ſheweth that had he ſtood or eaten of the tree of life, he ſhould have lived for ever. But falling, he did runne the hazard of the loſſe of that life that might have been had. Laſtly, if <hi>Adam</hi> coald not have gone to heaven in that nature that God had made him, the falling ſhort of eternal life could not have been any fault of his own; and the blame would have laid on the creation. Were it rational for God to require <hi>Adam</hi> to go to heaven, and yet no way to make him ſutable or fit for ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:168516:120"/>This were to require the whole tale of bricks, and to give no ſtraw. And for that Tenet of the Romiſh Doctors, I wonder that he ſhould ſtand upon it that <hi>Adam</hi> was endued with ſupernatural righteouſneſſe in that ſenſe, at leaſt, as they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, for look what righteouſneſſe <hi>Adam</hi> had, it was by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The had ſtood he had propagated it to poſterity. The reliques of the image of God do plainly ſhew in what ſtate he was made in the beginning. In the creation of man it is ſaid, he made all things very good, Hearbs, Trees, Birds, Beaſts, Fiſhes, all theſe may be good in their kinde, though they were not made in a ſtate fit to go to heaven. But it is impoſſible that <hi>Adam</hi> could be made in a ſtate very good, but he muſt be ſome way fit for union with God, in which all ſpiritual and eternal good doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>Now he comes to the main objection, and here he tells us that it is certain there is not only one, but many common principles from which ſin derives it ſelf into the manners of all men. This he undertakes to prove in oppoſition to our aſſertion, who hold that the pravity and corruption of nature doth flow from the diſobedience of the firſt man. But let us heare him ſpeak in his own words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt great cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of an univerſal implety, is, that at firſt God had made no promiſes of heaven, he had not propounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny glorious rewards to be as an argument to ſupport the ſuperiour fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty againſt the inferiour, that is, to make the will to chooſe the beſt &amp; to leave the worst, and to be as a reward for ſuffring contradiction,</hi> And going on, he further addeth this to be the reaſon of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral corruption of the old world; <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there was no ſuch thing in that period of the world, therefore almoſt all fleſh corrupted themſelves, excepting Abel, Seth, Enos, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch, we finde not one good man from Adam to Noah; and therefore the Apoſtle calls that world</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the world of the ungodly. It was not ſo much wonder, that when Adam had no promiſes made to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to conteſt his natural concupiſcence, he ſhould ſtrive to make his conditions by the Devils Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi> It is true the Apoſtle calleth the old world <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the world of ungodly,</hi> but that there were no ſpiritual promiſes in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:168516:121"/>thoſe times, this we utterly deny.</p>
               <p>What ſhall we make of that promiſe, <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall breake the Serpents head?</hi> What ſhall we make of the ſacrifices? were they not all figures of the blood of Chriſt to come? Saint <hi>Peter</hi> alſo plainly tells us, <hi>That the ſpirits of the fathers were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient in the times of the old world.</hi> In what ſenſe then doth he call them diſobedient? Their diſobedience muſt be expounded in reference to the teachings, convictions that they had by and through the Spirit of Chriſt, whether in <hi>Noahs</hi> Miniſtry or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Many more reaſons might be alledged to prove that the fathers were not altogether deſtitute of ſpiritual promiſes. If our Author will prove it, let him ſhew how they were too blame for their diſobedience.</p>
               <p>But he is as ſtrange in aſſigning that which he tearmes the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe of the general impiety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A ſecond cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the general iniquity of the world is, becauſe our nature is ſo hard put to it in many inſtances. Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nature is originally corrupted, but becauſe Gods laws command ſuch things which are a reſtraint to the indifferent, and otherwiſe law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inclinations of nature. And then going on, he doth in the ſame page explain himſelf more fully. Our unwillingneſſe and averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe came by occaſion of the Law coming croſſe upon our nature: not becauſe our nature is contrary unto God, but becauſe God was pleaſed to ſuper-induce ſome commandments contrary to our nature For if God had commanded us to eate the beſt meats and to drink the richeſt wines as long as they could pleaſe us, and were to be had, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it will not be thought that original ſinne would hinder us from obedience. But becauſe we are forbidden to do ſomethings which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally we deſire to do, and love, therefore our nature is hard put to it, and this is the cauſe of the difficulty.</hi> So farre he, page 413. 414, 415, 416.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> From theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches of his, I would entreat him (that is ſo apt to condemne others) to obſerve the rigour and the ſeverity of his own principles.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he tells us that there was no propoſal of ſpiritual promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the old world, and then Secondly, God laid ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon them, that were altogether above their natural a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and from the poſition of theſe two, he ſheweth us that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:168516:121"/>the world did ſo generally overflow with all kind of wickedneſſe. Theſe things are ſo extreame hard, that I do not finde their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel in any of our writers. They do indeed ſay that God giveth commands farre above natural abilities, but not farre above that natural ability that <hi>Adam</hi> was furniſhed withall in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, neither above that gracious ability which God hath enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf to beſtow in the Word of promiſe. But to amplifie commands upon feeble fleſh, and to make no ſpiritual promiſes anſwerable to the command, is plainly to make the Lord himſelf extreamely ſevere to the ſons of men. None of our Authours ever would allow ſuch a ſeverity.</p>
               <p>Of all the Ancients, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is the Authour that ſeems to be moſt rigorous in the points of original ſinne, and the natural ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude of the will, yet if we conſider the whole ſcope of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he doth not come near to the ſeverity of the poſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned; when ſome did reaſon with him, <hi>If there be no free-will, to what purpoſe exhortations and commands?</hi> I anſwe, this, he purpoſely wrote his book <hi>de correptione &amp; gratia,</hi> the effect of which is to this purpoſe, <hi>In commands know what thou oughteſt to do, in reproof know what thou haſt not done through thine own default, in prayer know whence thou mayſt receive what thou wouldſt have.</hi> And when the <hi>Pelagians</hi> did vehemently inculcate that which our Authour doth ſo much ſtand upon; <hi>Peccatum voluntatis an neceſſitatis eſt? ſi neceſſitatis eſt peccatum non eſt: ſi voluntatis vitari poteſt. Sinne (ſay they) is either of the will, or of neceſſity,) If it be of neceſſity, it is no ſinne, if it be of the will, it may be avoided.</hi> To this he hath a double anſwer. <hi>Firſt,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ſanemur, in vccamus eum cui dicitur in Pſalmo de neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatibus educ me. That we may be healed, we call upon him to whom it is ſaid in the Pſalme, bring me out of my neceſſities.</hi> His ſecond anſwer is, <hi>vitari poſſe peccatum ſi natura vitiata ſanetur gratiâ Dei per Jeſum Chriſtum Dominum noſtrum. Sinne may be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in caſe our corrupt nature may be healed by the grace of God through Jeſus Christ our Lord.</hi> There would be no end if we ſhould cite all the paſſages that he hath to this purpoſe. In which he doth acknowledge that we lie under a natural neceſſity of ſinning, but yet that neceſſity is not abſolute and irrecoverable where there is a want of ability to keep the command, there he
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:168516:122"/>doth referre us to the ability to be had from the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Of all our Authours in theſe latter times, <hi>Luther</hi> in his treatiſe <hi>de ſervo arbitrio,</hi> ſeemeth to ſpeak moſt hard, yet for all this in the caſe of commands above natural abilities he alwayes incourages men to go to free grace. He alwayes teſtifies that the Law is to be preached to kill and undo a ſinner, to put him under the curſe and under wrath, that ſo he may come to Chriſt. To let paſſe all enſamples, we will come to that one inſtance in the beginning of the book, when <hi>Eraſmus</hi> did argue in this wiſe. <hi>What profit or neceſſity is there to divulge ſuch things, ſeeing from thence ſo many evils may ſeem to ariſe.</hi> To this he hath a double anſwer. <hi>Prima eſt humiliatio noſtrae ſuper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="6 letters">
                        <desc>••••••</desc>
                     </gap> cognitio gratiae Dei, alteraipſa fides Chriſtiana, &amp;c. The firſt is the humiliation of our Pride, and the knowledge of the grace of God, the other is the Chriſtian faith it ſelf. Firſt, God certainly hath promiſed his grace to the humble, that is, to thoſe that are caſt down, and are without hope. Now a man cannot be throughly humbled, untill he know as wholly out of his own abilities, councels, ſtudies, wills, workes: ſo his ſalvation altogether to depend upon the dispoſal, councell, will, work of another that is of God alone. For as long as he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that he can do the leaſt for his ſalvation, he doth remaine in the truſt of himſelf, neither doth he wholly diſpaire of himſelf. Therefore is not humbled before God, but preſumeth upon place, time, or ſome work for himſelf either doth hope or at leaſt wiſh for that by which he may come to ſalvation. He therefore that doubteth not wholly to depend upon the will of God, altogether diſpaires of himſelf chooſes nothing, but expecteth God to work it in him, and for him, he is neareſt to ſalvation. More he hath to the ſame purpoſe,</hi> Concerning the ſecond reaſon, he hath theſe words, <hi>therefore ſaith he, that there maybe ſome place found for faith, it is needful that all things which are believed may be hidden out of ſight, and they cannot be further hidden than under the contrary object, ſenſe, experience. So God when he quickneth, he doth it by killing, when he justifieth, he doth that thing by convincing men of the guilt of ſin, when he lifteth up to heaven, he doth it by bringing down to hell,</hi> and much more to that purpoſe. All this is but a ſpecimen, or handſel of the doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> though he doth every where teach that there is no ability in man to obey the command, yet
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:168516:122"/>all ability is to he had in the word of promiſe. He doth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſhew that the uſe of the Law properly is to bring men to deſpair, that deſpairing in themſelves, they may be driven to Chriſt. He doth marvellouſly expreſſe the doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Epiſtle to the Romans and elſewhere. Now on the contrary, Doctor <hi>Jeremy Taylor</hi> tells us a contrary tale, that the Lord did encreaſe his commands above the ability of men in the times of the old world; and gave no ſpiritual promiſes in anſwer to the commands given in thoſe dayes, and this he doth avouch to be the true cauſe why iniquity did abound in that age. Now how he can make Religion intelligible by the poſition of ſuch principles, for my part I cannot underſtand. I think never any of our Divines was ever found to come to ſuch a high pitch of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity.</p>
               <p>Now we go to his next Section.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>SECT. 5.</hi> Of the liberty of election remaining after <hi>Adams</hi> fall.</head>
               <p>HEre he doth make it one chief part of his work, to prove the liberty of the will, to this purpoſe he bringeth many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt us, whereas (if he did well conſider the matter) we do not deny ſuch a natural faculty. Man hath a power in naturals and externals of Religion to uſe a liberty, and in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als when he is made free by Chriſt. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bringeth in this as one chief point of accuſation. <hi>They deny</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>free-will, ſo excellent and worthy a gift of God, and the beſt of all that are in man, by which alone we may be diſtinguiſht from bruit beaſts, and may come neareſt to the nature of Angels, and may beare the image of the Godhead it ſelf; which alſo the whole race of mankind upon the earth do teſtifie with great conſent of minde: A thing (I ſay,) ſo clear that almoſt every moment it cometh into the view of our eyes and minds: yet nevertheleſſe with incredible madneſſe, and fury, theſe men do moſt obſtinately refuſe, confute, and reject it.</hi> So far <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> In which words of his, if he ſpeak of liberty of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:168516:123"/>will, ſo farre as it is a faculty we do not deny it, we would as ſoon deny the fire to be hot, or the water to be moiſt. Onely this we deny in things ſpiritual, in matters that concerne ſalvation, a man hath no free will. Neither do we abſolutely ſay this in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, for though he hath no freedome by nature; he may be made free by grace. Grace doth not deſtroy the faculty, but doth perfect and adorne it. But of all our Authours let Doctor <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> in his anſwer to the challenge made by a Jeſuite in <hi>Ireland,</hi> lay downe our judgement, and then we ſhall ſee how fairely and honeſtly <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and now laſt of all, our Author himſelf does deal with us. <hi>That man hath free-will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not by us gain-ſaid: though we dare not give him ſo large a freedome as the Jeſuits preſume to do. Freedome of will we know doth as eſſentially belong unto a man as reaſon it ſelf: and he that ſpoileth him of that power, doth in effect make him a very beast. For this is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt reaſonable and unreaſonable creatures: as Damaſcene rightly noteth. The unreaſonable are rather led by nature, than themſelves are the leaders of it; and therefore do they never contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict their natural appetite, but aſſoon as they affect any thing, they ruſh to the proſecution of it. But man being endued with reaſon, doth rather led nature, than is lead by it: and therefore being moved with appetite, if he will he hath power to reſtraine his appetite, or to follow it. Hereby he is enabled to do the things which he doth neither by a brute inſtinct of nature, nor yet by any compulſion, but by advice and deliberation: the mind firſt taking into conſiderartion the grounds and circumſtances of each action, and freely debating on either ſide what in this caſe were beſt to be done, or not done, and then the will enclining it ſelf to put in execution the last and concluſive judgment of the practical underſtanding. This liberty we acknowledge, a man may exerciſe in all actions that are within his power to do whether they be lawful, unlawful, or indifferent, whether done, by the ſtrength of nature or of grace. For even in doing the workes of grace, our free will ſuſpendeth not her action, but being moved and guided by grace, doth that which is fit for her to do, grace not taking away that liberty which comes by Gods creation, but the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the will, that ariſeth from mans corruption.</hi> So farre Dr. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> page 465. In which words of his, if we ſpeak of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of free-will, we do not deny it to be a free faculty both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:168516:123"/>corruption and under grace, &amp; why ſhould we be upbraided, then with that which we do not maintaine? but if we ſpeak of the ſtrength and ability of free-will, it is our conſtant doctrine that naturally a man hath no freedome to that which is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally good till he is made free by grace. And ſo far as he is made free by grace, and the way to obtaine this freedome, the firſt ſtep is to ſee his ſlavery and his bondage-under corruption. Theſe things being premiſed and the ſtate of the queſtion made cleare, we will now come to ſee what our Author can alleadge to the contrary. He proceedeth as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The objection</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hinders not, but choice ſtill remaines to a man, and that he is not naturally ſinful, as he is naturally heavy, and upright, apt to laugh and weep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though in a ſenſe it is true, that a man is not naturally ſinful as he is naturally heavy, yet it is from the corruption, and pravity of his nature within, that he is ſtill apt to chooſe that which is evil. For though every man doth not chooſe the ſame ſin, nor for the ſame cauſe, neither doth he alwayes chooſe it, yet it is apparent that our wills are in a ſtate of ſervility, and that the power to chooſe the things that are good is naturally loſt. But he further addeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This doctrine is deſtructive to all laws, it takes away reward and puniſhment, and we have nothing whereby we can ſerve God, and precepts of holineſſe might be preached to a wolfe as well as a man, if men were naturally and inevitably wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe tearmes <hi>naturally and inevitably wicked</hi> are fallaciouſly coupled together. The <hi>Epheſians</hi> before their converſion were naturally wicked, <hi>they were by nature the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath as well as others.</hi> But will any man ſay, that they were inevitably wicked? how then could they be quickned and made alive againe by the infuſion of a new life? Further, it is not deſtructive to all laws to ſay a man is naturally wicked, for by the help of reſtraining grace, he may outwardly ſorbeare many evils which are forbidden in the law, onely his ſinfulneſſe lyes in this, that of himſelfe he cannot come up to the purity and ſpirituality of the law in the denyal of his luſts. Againe, though naturally he be under the reign of luſt, he doth not
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:168516:124"/>inevitably lye under that bondage. That reign may be broken, when he ſhall come to be acquainted with the liberty of the Spirit. <hi>The law of the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the law of ſinne and death,</hi> Rom. chap 8 2. Neither upon ſuch a ſuppoſal is it true, that precepts of holineſs may be given to a wolfe as well as a man. A wolfe is no way capable of precepts for want of faculties, he hath neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding will, nor any other power of the ſoul as a man hath. That of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is true. A man doth not believe the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is not in the faculty, but in the vicious habit that doth hinder the faculty. <hi>Poſſe credere naturae est hominum velle cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere gratiae eſt fidelium: to have a remote power to believe is of the nature of men, to have a will to believe is of the grace of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> But a wolfe hath neither nature nor grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and therefore he hath no precepts given to him to believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Upon this account (ſaith he) it is ſo far from being true, that a man after his fall did forfeit his natural power of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it ſeems rather to be encreaſed. For as a mans know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge grows, ſo his will comes to be better attended, and miniſtred unto. But after his fall his knowledge was much more than it was before; he knew what madneſſe was, and had experience of the difference of things, he perceived the evil and miſchief of diſobedience.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I willingly yield, that as a mans knowledge grows, his will comes to be better attended and miniſtred unto. But that his knowledge ſhould be much more after his fall than it was before: this goes againſt the whole ſcope of Scripture. For one chief cauſe of the ſervility and vaſſallage of the natural man under ſin, doth ariſe from the blindneſſe and darkneſſe of his judgement. This is moſt lively ſet forth in the words of the Apoſtle. <hi>The wiſdome of the fleſh is enmity againſt God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not ſubject to the law, nor can be,</hi> Rom. 8.7. We will explaine the particulars in order. The wiſdome of the fleſh in the Original is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Saplence, prudence, and minde of the fleſh. That which the eye is to the body to direct and guide it, the ſame is this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or minde of the fleſh to the will, and other faculties: it teacheth them what to chooſe, and what to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:168516:124"/>refuſe, what to love, and what to hate? Now a man cannot chooſe the things of God, till he doth ſee the excellency of them. Further, to ſhew the miſery of the natural man, the wiſdome of his fleſh is ſaid <hi>to be enmity againſt God.</hi> He doth not ſay, an enemy in the concrete, but enmity it ſelfe in the abſtract; that is, an enemy in the higheſt degree. God is an enemy to ſuch a minde, and ſuch a minde is an enemy to God. And therefore in the third place he gives a reaſon of the enmity, <hi>it is not ſubject to the law of God,</hi> for the chief deſigne of the minde of the fleſh, is to ſet up other Gods in place of the true God; other Lords in direct oppoſition to the law of the Spirit. When men ſhould truſt in the Lord alone, this wiſdome doth prompt them to truſt in horſes, and armies for victory, in good husbandry for riches, in friends for preferment in the world, &amp;c. And this is the reaſon wherefore the wiſedome of the fleſh is called enmity againſt God, becauſe it is alwayes tempting, and allur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to love the things of the world, to delight in them, and to truſt in them more than the true God. Nay, the Apoſtle goes a ſtep further, he doth not ſay that it is not ſubject, but it cannot <hi>be ſubject to the law of God.</hi> He doth not deny only an actual ſubjection, but that which is more, he denyes a potential ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection alſo. Among ſeveral kinds of birds and beaſts, there are many that are not actually ſubject to man, yet there is nothing doth exclude, but they may be brought under ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. But the wiſdome of the fleſh is ſuch, that it cannot be made ſubjection by art, or induſtry, or any outward meanes till grace comes. If this be ſo, it is ſtrange to me that any man ſhould ſo far forget himſelf, to affirme that a mans <hi>knowledge is more after his fall than it was before,</hi> ſeeing a great part of his miſery lyeth in the blindneſſe of his judgement. And therefore as in the old creation, ſo it is in the new. The firſt work is in making of light, <hi>God that commanded the light to ſhine out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hath commanded the light of his grace to ſhine in your hearts in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4 6. By the ſame argument as he proves <hi>Adams</hi> knowledge to be greater after, than it was before his fall, he may prove us to have more knowledge than Chriſt. Of Chriſt it is peculiarly ſaid, <hi>he made him ſin that knew no ſin,</hi> we have an experimental knowledge of ſin that Chriſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:168516:125"/>never had: ſo <hi>Adam</hi> had an experimental knowledge of ſin and miſery, after which he never had before his fall. But he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We may</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as well ſuppoſe an underſtanding that can never underſtand, and paſſions that can never deſire nor refuſe, and a memory that can never remember, as a will that cannot chooſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though it be a prepoſterous thing to imagine a will that cannot chooſe, yet there is no ſtrangeneſſe to conceive of a will that cannot chooſe the things of the Spirit. To chooſe is natural to the will, as it is to fire to burne, to the memory to remember; but to chooſe the things of the Spirit of God, this muſt be from ſupernatural operation. When the rich Marchant found the pearle hid in the field, for joy he went and ſold all that he had, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.44. But he ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As ſin is the action of a free faculty, it can no more take away the freedome of that faculty than vertue can, for that alſo is the action of the ſame free faculty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Neither do we ſay, that ſin takes away the freedome of the faculty, for all that do commit ſin, do freely commit it, only it takes away the freedome to that which is ſpiritually good. In this ſence our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that commits ſin, is the ſervant of ſin,</hi> Joh. 8.36. <hi>While they promiſe themſelves liberty, they themſelves are the ſervants of corruption,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.19. But he further ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Men ſometimes by evil habits, and by chooſing vile things along time together make it morally impoſſible to chooſe that which is good, and to love that in particular which is contrary to their evil cuſtomes.</hi> Heraclitus <hi>ſaith, custome is that devil that bringeth in new natures upon us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is moſt certaine true, that many fall under the power of evil by long cuſtome. But the maine queſtion is, Whether is evil cuſtome the whole and adequate cauſe of the evil? This we deny: men by ill cuſtome may intend the habit of original ſin, as varniſh may make colours more orient, and God in his juſt judgement may juſtly harden men in their ſin, ſo that they may be worſe than the ordinary ſort of natural men. This we do willingly confeſſe, but then alſo we muſt conſider
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:168516:125"/>that the bottome, and the ground of all the evil doth lye in a ſinful nature. This doth naturally deſcend upon us all from <hi>Adam,</hi> the root of corruption, and is only to be done away by Chriſt, the root of all grace, life, ſpiritual nature, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do abundantly teſtifie. Next, he cometh to the teſtimony of the Philoſophers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca ſaith, nature doth not engage us upon a vice, ſhe made us entire, ſhe left us free, but we make our ſelves priſoners, and ſlaves by vicious habits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is no way to be doubted, but we make our ſelves ſlaves by vicious habits of our own acquiring. But whereas <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, nature hath made us free, nature hath left us free, theſe are thoſe rudiments of the world of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>beware leaſt any man ſpaile you through Philoſophy,</hi> Col. 2 7. If nature hath made us free, what need is there of Chriſt, of the freedome of the Spirit, of the grace of regeneration, of all thoſe things that are held forth to us in the principles of baptiſme and circumciſion? In this ſence the Apoſtle is to be underſtood, when he ſaith, <hi>beware lest any man spoile you through Philoſophy,</hi> he doth not ſpeak of the knowledge that the Philoſophers have of the motions of the heavens, and the meaſures of the earth, and ſuch like ſpeculations, but he ſpeaks of Philoſophy as it doth not hold Chriſt the Head, and is contrary to the very principles of baptiſme, and circumciſion, as may be ſee by the context. Of this kinde are thoſe ſayings of <hi>Seneca, nature hath made us free, nature hath left us free,</hi> ſuch doctrines are contrary to Chriſt the Head. He further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Saints</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>love God ſo fully, that they cannot hate him or deſire to diſpleaſe him. And in hell the accurſed ſpirits ſo perfectly hate him, that they can never love him; But in this, that is, ſtatus viae a middle condition between both, or a paſſage to one or the other it cannot be ſuppoſed to be ſo, unleſſe a man here alſo be already ſaved or damned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We do agree, that the Saints in heaven do ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love God, that they cannot hate him, and the damned ſpirits in hell do ſo abſolutely hate him, that they cannot love him. But what of all this? The caſe of ſinners upon the earth, is not
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:168516:126"/>all one with the damned in hell. The damned in hell do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and irrecoverably hate God, but ſo do not ſinners upon the earth. Though they are borne in ſin, and lye under a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural neceſſity of ſinning, yet they do not hate God abſolutely and irrecoverably, but ſo far only as they are naturally corrupt and do remaine in their natural condition. Though Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the general do know that all ſhall not be ſaved, yet perſonally and individually no Miniſter can ſay that this or that man ſhall not be ſaved. They can ſay, as long as men continue in ſuch wayes they are in the way to damnation, but cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and infallibly pronounce of the final, and eternal eſtate of this or that particular man. Now it is not ſo with the damned in hell. But he further ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Men can chooſe that which is commanded, and abſtaine from that which is forbidden, for if they could not, they ought no more to periſh for this, than infants for that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though we ſtand upon it, that a man cannot naturally chooſe that which is ſpiritually good, yet his caſe is not all one with the ſtate and condition of an infant. For an infant cannot actually underſtand, will, nill, chooſe, refuſe, but a natural man hath a power to will that which is in his own compaſſe, he may performe many outward duties, abſtaine from many outward evils, and fly many occaſions of ſin. And for his willing the good that is ſpiritual, though he cannot chooſe it ſo far forth as is natural, yet doubtleſſe his condemnation ſhall be, that he did not go ſo far as he might go by the help of the Spirit. At ſome ſeaſons the Spirit doth convince, accuſe, reprove, terrifie, and put him upon a way of judging and condemning of himſelf, that ſo he might look after pardoning and healing mercy. But his fault is, that he will not ſee that which he may ſee, and doth obſtinately harden himſelfe againſt the light. But he further ſheweth,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is ſo neceſſary a truth, that it is one of the greatest grounds and neceſſities of obedience and holy living; and if after the fall of</hi> Adam <hi>it be not by God permitted to us to chooſe or refuſe, there is nothing left whereby a man can ſerve God or affer him a ſacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though the Divines do maintaine a neceſſity of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:168516:126"/>ſinning, and the loſſe of the liberty of the will, to ſpiritual good at leaſt; they are not caſt upon ſuch a ſtrait as our Author thinks they are. Indeed ſome of them are more cleare, and diſtinct, and do give leſſe offence than others do, yet I know none do abſolutely take away the power from the will to chooſe or refuſe. To what purpoſe then would exhortations, admonitions, and reproofes be given? But leaving all others, we will cite a teſtimony out of one of the chiefeſt of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, for he may ſerve as a patterne for the reſt. Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in his book of Inſtitutions, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. doth ſhew, that the foundation of all ſound learning is grounded upon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a mans ſelfe. But how? not upon the knowledge of a mans own excellencies, perfections, natural liberties, for ſo the Philoſophers do vainly trifle: But upon the knowledge of his own miſery, thraldome under ſin, and this he affirmes to be the bottome of all ſaving knowledge to bring men to Chriſt. By the former kind of learning men are ſet up, and by the latter they are pluckt down. He ſpeaks of two dangerous extreames to be avoided on either ſide, ſome when they heare that a man hath no ability, no freedome of will, they give over all care of piety and godlineſſe: On the other ſide, others truſting in their own ability, liberty of will, and the like, they bereave the Lord of that honour that is due to him. He ſheweth that a middle courſe is to be taken between theſe two extreames, and that the rocks on either ſide are to be declined. For the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, he ſheweth how far a natural man may go in all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, civil, eccleſiaſtical actions, and how (by the general aſſiſtance and concurrence of the Spirit) he may do great things in all Phyſical, Mathematical, Ethical, Oeconomical, and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical kinds of learning. Only when he cometh to that which is ſpiritual, here he plainly tells us that a man hath no power, and to uſe the words of the Author, he hath no ability <hi>to offer a ſacrifice to God.</hi> What is then to be done? here he tells us, <hi>that we muſt have recourſe to the freeneſſe of the promiſe where all fulneſſe is to be had.</hi> To that end he cites the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah, I will poure water upon him that is thirſty, and floods of water upon the dry ground,</hi> Iſa. chap. 44.3. And againe, <hi>Ho, every one that thinſteth, come ye to the waters of life,</hi> chap. 55.1.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:168516:127"/>Having cited theſe and ſuch like paſſages, he comes to cloſe in theſe words: <hi>Quae teſtantur ad percipiendas dei benedictiones, nullos admit ti niſi ſuae paupertatis ſenſu tabeſcentes. Which teſtifieth to the receiving of the bleſſings of God, no others are to be admitted, but ſuch only which languiſh with a ſence of their own poverty</hi> And then he addeth. <hi>Semper ſanè mihi vehementer illud Chryſostomi placuit; Fundamentum noſtrae Philoſophiae eſſe humilitatem. That of Chriſoſtome hath alwayes pleaſed me exceedingly. Humility to be the foundation of our Philoſophy. Or rather that of</hi> Augnſtine, <hi>even as the Retoricion ſaith, when he was demanded, what was the chief thing in the precepts of eloquence, anſwered, pronunciation, what the ſecond, pronunciation, what the third, pronunciation: So if thou mayeſt ask me concerning the precepts of Chriſtian Religion, firſt, ſecond and third, alway it would pleaſe me to give this anſwer, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> and more he hath to the ſame purpoſe. I have drawn out the words more at length, becauſe the Author himſelfe is a chiefe leader in the reformed Churches, and becauſe indeed, <hi>they are the patterne of whole ſome words.</hi> By this our Author may underſtand, though Original ſin be aſſerted, the natural liberty of the will denyed, and the neceſſity of ſinning intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, yet nevertheleſſe according to the tenour of theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, men may have a ſacrifice to offer, and exhortations may be of good uſe. Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> in his Treatiſe of humiliation, <hi>pag.</hi> 224. doth propound the queſtion, who is able to practiſe according to his knowledge? His anſwer is, <hi>and I will appeale to any mans experience, let him look back to the courſe of his life and examine himſelfe, was there any particular action in all thy life from which thou waſt ſo hindred that thou cauſt ſay, that thou couldſt not do it? was there any particular ſin of which thou couldeſt ſay, this ſin I could not abſtaine from? And howſoever we may make it a matter of diſpute in the Schooles, yet the worſt man, in whom we may think corruption of nature to be moſt ſtrong, when he comes to dye, doth not excuſe himſelfe, but acknowledges he is guilty.</hi> In the next page he propounds the maine objection. <hi>How can a man he condemned for not believing and turning to God, when naturally he hath no power to do theſe things?</hi> To this he anſwers. Though a man hath no power to believe and repent, yet he is condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the neglect of ſuch precedent actions which he had a
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:168516:127"/>liberty to do, &amp;c. Our Divines in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> in the Suffrage of the <hi>Britans,</hi> do diſtinguiſh betwixt regeneration, and thoſe antecedaneous acts that lead towards regeneration. Theſe antecedaneous acts, a natural man (by the help of the Spirit) may do as to ſee ſinne, mourne over it, judge himſelfe for it, he may go further, he may taſte the ſweetneſſe of the promiſe, and have ſome beginnings of joyes, all which he may fall from: many other teſtimonies may be brought to ſhew that our Authours, by the tenour of their principles do not extinguiſh the endeavour of man, but do rather more truely direct and inſtruct men to follow the right courſe. I ſhall ſtay too long upon this point, becauſe I perceive that it is the chief rock of offence that our Author doth ſtumple at: he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſheweth,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>All things elſe are determined, and fixed by the divine providence even all the actions of men, but the inward act of the will, is left under the command of laws only and under the arreſt of threatnings, and the invitation of promiſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its true, that laws, threatnings, promiſes, are made with ſpecial reſpect to the will. But that the inward act of the will ſhould be ſo under laws, that it ſhould not be under the decree of God: this Tenet doth exclude the chiefeſt part of the world from being under the care of God. Nay, if the matter be well conſidered, here is the very height of the Atheiſme of the ancient Philoſophers. To maintaine the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſſe, independency, and ſovereignty of the will of man upon the earth, they do deny the providence of God in heaven. <hi>Cicero</hi> upon this reaſon, did deny the infallibility of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of God. And our Authour ſeemeth to me to come too near to this coaſt. In the next words he gives his reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And that this is left for man, can no way impede any of the divine decrees, becauſe the outward act being over-ruled by the divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, it is ſtrange that the Schooles will leave nothing to man whereby he may glorifie God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it be ſuppoſed that the inward act of the will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the decree of God, as well as the outward action, this doth
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:168516:128"/>not take away that by and through which we may glorifie God. For it is not all kinds of neceſſity that are contrary to liberty, but ſome onely. The neceſſity of nature, the neceſſities of a bruit inſtinct, and outward compulſion cannot ſtand with liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but the neceſſity of the decree of God, the neceſſity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, the neceſſity of the creatures dependency can be proved to conſiſt with liberty. For God uſually brings his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees to paſſe by the free act of his creature, which work under his decrees, and are ſubſervient to thoſe ends that he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. And for the inward motions of the will, innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble examples may be brought to prove that they are under the decrees of God. <hi>The Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, and he turneth it about as the ſtreams of water,</hi> Prov. 21.1. <hi>God hath put it into their hearts to hate the whore, and to burne her fleſh with fire,</hi> Apoc. 17.11. And ſpeaking of the <hi>Egyptians, he turned their heart to hate his people,</hi> Pſal. 105.25. Beſides the promiſe. <hi>A new heart and a new ſpirit I will give them,</hi> Ezek. 36.26. <hi>The Pſalmiſt prayed, create in me a cleane heart O God, and renew within me a right Spirit,</hi> Pſal. 51.10. All theſe places of Scripture do abundantly prove, that the inward act of the will is under the decree of God, as well as under laws, and that the certainty of the decree doth not overturne the liberty of the will, but both do go together. Next he tells us:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Auguſtine in his zeale againſt a certaine errour of the Pelagians, made him take in auxiliaries from an uncertaine and leſſe diſcerned errour, and cauſed him to ſay many things which all antiquity diſavowed, and which the following ages took up upon his account.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The following ages, ſpecially ſince the times of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have adhered to the doctrine of <hi>Augustine.</hi> But that the Sager ſort have done this meerly upon his account, we cannot eaſily admit. They have followed him ſo far, as his interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have come nearer to the natural and genuine ſence of Scripture. What hard ſpeeches he hath concerning original ſin, the natural ſervitude of the will, the ſpirituality of the law, and the imperfection of man; the rigour and auſterity of them will be well allayed, by comparing them with other ſweet ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his concerning the fulneſſe of Chriſt, and the freeneſſe
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:168516:128"/>of the promiſes. His ſcope is no way to hinder the endeavour of man, but to ground and ſettle it upon ſuch principles that are more ſolid and divine. And whereas our Author in his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num Neceſſarium,</hi> and his further explication, doth commend the Fathers before the times of <hi>Auguiſtine</hi> for their temperate ſpeeches concerning free-will: Here many things are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Firſt, who will aſſures us that he may not do the ſame with their authorities about free-will, as he doth with the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the ſence of the Article in the point of Original ſin? If he will pervert the plaine ſence of that which is open in the view of all men, what may he not do with the teſtimonies of the Ancients? Beſides, what he alleadgeth for free-will out of <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Cyril, Hierome,</hi> and others, thoſe ſpeeches may admit of a benigne interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All Divines do agree that a man hath free-will, he hath a power to underſtand, to chooſe, to refuſe, to act by counſell, he were not a man if he could not do this. The ſpeeches of the Fathers may be taken in ſuch an abſolute ſence: in relation alſo to a particular ſtate, <hi>Adam</hi> had free-will in innocency; and the Saints have free-will to that which is ſpiritually good in the ſtate of grace: Further, ſuppoſe ſome things have eſcaped from them that have been leſſe authentick, let us conſider that many of them came new out of the Schooles of the Philoſophers, and therefore together with the truth they might mingle ſome errours of Philoſophy. Their conflicts alſo were with the Philoſophers, and the Maniches, and therefore it was neceſſary that they ſhould ſpeak ſomething more than ordinary for the liberty of the will. But enough of this matter, which is ſo largely ſpoken and ſo plentifully by others.</p>
